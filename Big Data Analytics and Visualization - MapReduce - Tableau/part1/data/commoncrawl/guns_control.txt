GUN CONTROL
Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?
The United States has 120.5 guns per 100 people, or about 393,347,000 guns, which is the highest total and per capita number in the world. 22% of Americans own one or more guns (35% of men and 12% of women). America's pervasive gun culture stems in part from its colonial history, revolutionary roots, frontier expansion, and the Second Amendment, which states: "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
Proponents of more gun control laws state that the Second Amendment was intended for militias; that gun violence would be reduced; that gun restrictions have always existed; and that a majority of Americans, including gun owners, support new gun restrictions.
Opponents say that the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to own guns; that guns are needed for self-defense from threats ranging from local criminals to foreign invaders; and that gun ownership deters crime rather than causes more crime. Read more background...
Top Pro & Con Arguments
The Second Amendment is not an unlimited right to own guns. Gun control laws are just as old or older than the Second Amendment (ratified in 1791). Some examples of gun control throughout colonial America included criminalizing the transfer of guns to Catholics, slaves, indentured servants, and Native Americans; regulating the storage of gun powder in homes; banning loaded guns in Boston houses; and mandating participation in formal gathering of troops and door-to-door surveys about guns owned. [1] [2] In the June 26, 2008 District of Columbia et al. v. Heller US Supreme Court majority opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia, LLB, wrote, "Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited… nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms." [3] On June 9, 2016 the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 7-4 that "[t]he right of the general public to carry a concealed firearm in public is not, and never has been, protected by the Second Amendment," thus upholding a law requiring a permitting process and "good cause" for concealed carry licenses in California. [145] [146] A 2018 study found that 91% of the 1,153 court cases with claims stating a government action or law violates the Second Amendment between the 2008 DC v. Heller decision and Feb. 1, 2016 failed. [157]
More gun control laws would reduce gun deaths. There were 464,033 total gun deaths between 1999 and 2013: 270,237 suicides (58.2% of total deaths); 174,773 homicides (37.7%); and 9,983 unintentional deaths (2.2%). [4] Guns were the leading cause of death by homicide (66.6% of all homicides) and by suicide (52.2% of all suicides). [4] David Frum, Daily Beast and CNN contributor, stated, "American children under age 15 were nine times more likely to die of a gun accident than children in other advanced wealthy countries… About 200 Americans go to emergency rooms every day with gunshot wounds." [5] A study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that "legal purchase of a handgun appears to be associated with a long-lasting increased risk of violent death" [6] According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, implementing federal universal background checks could reduce firearm deaths by a projected 56.9%; background checks for ammunition purchases could reduce deaths by a projected 80.7%; and gun identification requirements could reduce deaths by a projected 82.5%. [148] Gun licensing laws were associated with a 14% decrease in firearm homicides, while increases in firearm homicides were seen in places with right-to-carry and stand-your ground-laws.[158] [160]
High-capacity magazines should be banned because they too often turn murder into mass murder. A Mother Jones investigation found that high-capacity magazines were used in at least 50% of the 62 mass shootings between 1982 and 2012. [7] When high-capacity magazines were used in mass shootings, the death rate rose 63% and the injury rate rose 156%. [8] David H. Chipman, Senior Vice President of Public Safety for ShotSpotter and former Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) agent, stated that a high-capacity magazine "turns a killer into a killing machine." [7] Some gang members use high-capacity magazines, such as 30 rounds or even 90 rounds, to compensate for lack of accuracy and maximize the chance to harm. [9]
More gun control laws are needed to protect women from domestic abusers and stalkers. Five women are murdered with guns every day in the United States. [10] A woman's risk of being murdered increases 500% if a gun is present during a domestic dispute. [11] During the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, 5,364 US soldiers were killed in action between Oct. 7, 2001 and Jan. 28, 2015; between 2001 and 2012 6,410 women were killed with a gun by an intimate partner in the United States. [10] [12] A 2003 study of 23 populous high-income countries found that 86% of women killed by firearms were in the United States and American women are 11.4 times more likely to be the victims of gun homicides [13] 57% of mass shootings involved domestic violence. [11] [14] For example, the 2011 mass shooting at a Seal Beach, CA hair salon reportedly began because of the shooter's custody battle with his ex-wife who was a hair stylist at the salon. [11] [8] 31 states do not ban convicted misdemeanor stalkers from owning guns and 41 states do not force convicted domestic abusers from relinquishing guns they already own. [10] [14] 76% of women murdered and 85% of women who survived a murder attempt by an intimate partner were stalked in the year before the murder or murder attempt. [15]
Guns are rarely used in self-defense. Of the 29,618,300 violent crimes committed between 2007 and 2011, 0.79% of victims (235,700) protected themselves with a threat of use or use of a firearm, the least-employed protective behavior. [16] In 2010 there were 230 "justifiable homicides" in which a private citizen used a firearm to kill a felon, compared to 8,275 criminal gun homicides (or, 36 criminal homicides for every "justifiable homicide"). [17] Of the 84,495,500 property crimes committed between 2007 and 2011, 0.12% of victims (103,000) protected themselves with a threat of use or use of a firearm. [16]
Legally owned guns are frequently stolen and used by criminals. A June 2013 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report states that "[a]lmost all guns used in criminal acts enter circulation via initial legal transaction." [18] Between 2005 and 2010, 1.4 million guns were stolen from US homes during property crimes (including burglary and car theft), a yearly average of 232,400. [19] Ian Ayres, JD, PhD, and John J. Donohue, JD, PhD, Professors of Law at Yale Law School and Stanford Law School respectively, state, "with guns being a product that can be easily carried away and quickly sold at a relatively high fraction of the initial cost, the presence of more guns can actually serve as a stimulus to burglary and theft. Even if the gun owner had a permit to carry a concealed weapon and would never use it in furtherance of a crime, is it likely that the same can be said for the burglar who steals the gun?" [20]
Gun control laws would reduce the societal costs associated with gun violence. According to the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation (PIRE), in 2010, gun violence cost each person in the United States roughly $564 and the US government $5.5 billion in lost tax revenue; $4.7 billion in court costs; $1.4 billion in Medicare and Medicaid costs; $180 million in mental health care for victims; $224 million in insurance claims processing; and $133 million for law enforcement and medic response to shooting injuries. [21] [22] In 2010, there were 36,341 emergency room visits and 25,024 hospitalizations for gun injuries, costing an estimated $6.3 million. [23] 84% of those injured by firearms are uninsured, leaving taxpayers responsible for most of those bills through programs like Medicaid. [23] [24] [25] [26] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the costs of gun violence can include legal services, medical costs, perpetrator control, policing, incarceration, foster care, private security, lost earnings and time, life insurance, productivity, tourism, and psychological costs (pain and suffering), among others. [25] Homicide rates doubling has been associated with a 12.5% decline in property values. [25]
A majority of adults, including gun owners, support common sense gun control such as background checks, bans on assault weapons, and bans on high-capacity magazines. According to a Feb. 20, 2018 Quinnipiac Poll, 97% of American voters and 97% of gun owners support universal background checks. 67% support a nationwide ban on assault weapons, and 83% support mandatory waiting periods for gun purchases. [155] As much as 40% of all gun sales are undocumented private party gun sales that do not require a background check (aka the "gun show loophole"). [28] 56% of all adults surveyed approve of assault weapon bans and 53% of all adults surveyed approve of high-capacity magazine bans. [27] 89% of adults with a gun in the home approve of laws to prevent the purchase of guns by the mentally ill, and 82% approve of banning gun sales to people on no-fly lists. [27] Don Macalady, member of Hunters against Gun Violence, stated, "As a hunter and someone who has owned guns since I was a young boy, I believe that commonsense gun legislation makes us all safer. Background checks prevent criminals and other dangerous people from getting guns." [29]
More gun control leads to fewer suicides. Between 1999 and 2013 there were 270,237 firearm suicides in the United States, accounting for about 52% of all suicides during those years. [4] According to a Mar. 2014 study, when gun ownership went down in the United States, overall suicide rates went down. [30] [31] Firearm-related suicides accounted for 61% of the gun deaths in the United States between 2000 and 2010. [18] A Dec. 2009 study found "general barrier to firearm access created through state regulation can have a significant deterrent effect on male suicide rates in the United States. Permit requirements and bans on sales to minors were the most effective of the regulations analyzed." [32] In Indiana and Connecticut, after "red flag" laws to remove guns from people who may pose a threat were enacted, gun suicides decreased by 7.5% and 13.7% respectively, while suicides by other means did not decrease during the same time. [158] [159] A person who wants to kill him/herself is unlikely to commit suicide with poison or a knife when a gun is unavailable. [33]
Enacting gun control laws such as mandatory safety features would reduce the number of accidental gun deaths. Approximately 50% of unintentional fatal shootings were self-inflicted; and most unintentional firearm deaths were caused by friends or family members. [18] [4] According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the National Physicians Alliance, states with the highest concentration of guns have nine times the amount of accidental gun deaths and "89% of unintentional shooting deaths of children occur in the home—and most of these deaths occur when children are playing with a loaded gun in their parents’ absence." [34] The US General Accountability Office (GAO) estimated that 31% of total accidental shooting deaths could have been prevented by installing safety devices on guns: 100% of deaths per year in which a child under 6 years old shoots and kills him/herself or another child could be prevented by automatic child-proof safety locks; and 23% of accidental shooting deaths by adolescents and adults per year could be prevented by loading indicators showing when a bullet was in the chamber ready to be fired. [35] Marjorie Sanfilippo, PhD, Professor of Psychology at Eckerd College who has researched children’s behavior around guns, stated, "We put gates around swimming pools to keep children from drowning. We put safety caps on medications to keep children from poisoning themselves… [B]ecause children are naturally curious and impulsive, and because we have shown time and again that we cannot 'gun-proof' them with education, we have a responsibility to keep guns out of the hands of children." [36]
The presence of a gun makes a conflict more likely to become violent. The FBI found that in 2013 arguments (such as romantic triangles, brawls fueled by alcohol or drugs, and arguments over money) resulted in 1,962 gun deaths (59.9% of the total). [37] A June 1985 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that "the weapons used [in altercations]… were those closest at hand." [38] An editorial published in the June 1985 American Journal of Public Health noted, "gun-inflicted deaths [often] ensue from impromptu arguments and fights; in the US, two-thirds of the 7,900 deaths in 1981 involving arguments and brawls were caused by guns." [39] A 1993 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that "[r]ather than confer protection, guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance." [40]
Armed civilians are unlikely to stop crimes and are more likely to make dangerous situations, including mass shootings, more deadly. None of the 62 mass shootings between 1982 and 2012 was stopped by an armed civilian. [41] Gun rights activists regularly state that a 2002 mass shooting at the Appalachian School of Law in Virginia was stopped by armed students, but those students were current and former law enforcement officers and the killer was out of bullets when subdued. [41] Other mass shootings often held up as examples of armed citizens being able to stop mass shootings involved law enforcement or military personnel and/or the shooter had stopped shooting before being subdued, such as a 1997 high school shooting in Pearl, MS; a 1998 middle school dance shooting in Edinboro, PA; a 2007 church shooting in Colorado Springs, CO; and a 2008 bar shooting in Winnemucca, NV. [42] Jeffrey Voccola, Assistant Professor of Writing at Kutztown University, notes, "The average gun owner, no matter how responsible, is not trained in law enforcement or on how to handle life-threatening situations, so in most cases, if a threat occurs, increasing the number of guns only creates a more volatile and dangerous situation." [43]
Countries with restrictive gun control laws have lower gun homicide and suicide rates than the United States. Both Switzerland and Finland require gun owners to acquire licenses and pass background checks that include mental and criminal records, among other restrictions and requirements. [44] In 2007 Switzerland ranked number 3 in international gun ownership rates with 45.7 guns per 100 people (about 3,400,000 guns total). [45] In 2009 Switzerland had 24 gun homicides (0.31 deaths per 100,000 people) and 253 gun suicides (3.29 deaths per 100,000 people). [44] Finland ranked fourth in international gun ownership rates with 45.3 guns per 100 people (about 2,400,000 guns total). [45] In 2007 Finland had 23 (0.43 deaths per 100,000 people) gun homicides and 172 gun suicides (4.19 deaths per 100,000 people). [44] The United States, categorized as having "permissive" firearm regulation by GunPolicy.org, ranked first in international gun ownership rates with 88.8 guns per 100 people (about 270,000,000 guns total). [44] [45] In 2007 the United States had 12,632 gun homicides (4.19 deaths per 100,000 people) and 17,352 gun suicides (5.76 deaths per 100,000 people). [44] [4] Harvard professor David Hemenway, PhD, wrote "We analyzed the relationship between homicide and gun availability using data from 26 developed countries from the early 1990s. We found that across developed countries, where guns are more available, there are more homicides." [46] According to a Mar. 2016 study, gun homicide rates in the United States were 25.3 times higher and gun suicides were 8 times higher in 2010 than in other populous, high-income countries. Additionally, 90% of women, 91% of 0- to 14-year olds, 92% of 15- to 24-year-olds, and 82% of all people killed by firearms were from the United States. [147]
The Second Amendment was intended to protect the right of militias to own guns, not the right of individuals. Former Justice John Paul Stevens, JD, in his dissenting opinion for District of Columbia et al. v. Heller, wrote, "the Framer's single-minded focus in crafting the constitutional guarantee 'to keep and bear arms' was on military use of firearms, which they viewed in the context of service in state militias," hence the inclusion of the phrase "well regulated militia." [3] Michael Waldman, JD, President of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, stated there is nothing about an individual right to bear arms in the notes about the Second Amendment when it was being drafted, discussed, or ratified; the US Supreme Court declined to rule in favor of the individual right four times between 1876 and 1939; and all law articles on the Second Amendment from 1888 to 1959 stated that an individual right was not guaranteed. [47]
Civilians, including hunters, should not own military-grade firearms or firearm accessories. President Ronald Reagan and others did not think the AR-15 military rifle (also called M16s by the Air Force) should be owned by civilians and, when the AR-15 was included in the assault weapons ban of 1994 (which expired on Sep. 13, 2004), the NRA supported the legislation. [48] The Second Amendment was written at a time when the most common arms were long rifles that had to be reloaded after every shot. Civilians today have access to folding, detaching, or telescoping stocks that make the guns more easily concealed and carried; silencers to muffle gunshot sounds; flash suppressors to fire in low-light conditions without being blinded by the flash and to conceals the shooter’s location; or grenade launcher attachments. [49] Jonathan Lowy, Director of Legal Action Project at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, stated, "These are weapons that will shred your venison before you eat it, or go through the walls of your apartment when you’re trying to defend yourself… [they are] made for mass killing, but not useful for law-abiding citizens." [50]
The Second Amendment of the US Constitution protects individual gun ownership. The Second Amendment of the US Constitution reads, "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed." Gun ownership is an American tradition older than the country itself and is protected by the Second Amendment; more gun control laws would infringe upon the right to bear arms. Justice Antonin Scalia, LLB, in the June 26, 2008 District of Columbia et al. v. Heller US Supreme Court majority opinion syllabus stated, "The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home." [3] The McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010) ruling also stated that the Second Amendment is an individual right. [51] Lawrence Hunter, Chairman of Revolution PAC, stated, "The Founders understood that the right to own and bear laws is as fundamental and as essential to maintaining liberty as are the rights of free speech, a free press, freedom of religion and the other protections against government encroachments on liberty delineated in the Bill of Rights." [52]
Gun control laws do not deter crime; gun ownership deters crime. A Nov. 26, 2013 study found that, between 1980 and 2009, "assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level" and "states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders." [103] While gun ownership doubled in the twentieth century, the murder rate decreased. [53] John R. Lott, Jr., PhD, author of More Guns, Less Crime: Understanding Crime and Gun Control Laws, stated, "States with the largest increases in gun ownership also have the largest drops in violent crimes... The effect on 'shall-issue' [concealed gun] laws on these crimes [where two or more people were killed] has been dramatic. When states passed these laws, the number of multiple-victim shootings declined by 84 percent. Deaths from these shootings plummeted on average by 90 percent and injuries by 82 percent." [54] A Dec. 10, 2014 Pew survey found that 57% of people believe that owning a gun protects them from being victimized. [55] Journalist John Stossel explained, "Criminals don't obey the law… Without the fear of retaliation from victims who might be packing heat, criminals in possession of these [illegal] weapons now have a much easier job... As the saying goes, 'If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.'" [56]
Gun control laws infringe upon the right to self-defense and deny people a sense of safety. According to the National Rifle Association (NRA), guns are used for self-defense 2.5 million times a year. [57] The police cannot protect everyone all of the time. 61% of men and 56% of women surveyed by Pew Research said that stricter gun laws would "make it more difficult for people to protect their homes and families." [58] Nelson Lund, JD, PhD, Professor at George Mason University School of Law, stated, "The right to self-defense and to the means of defending oneself is a basic natural right that grows out of the right to life" and "many [gun control laws] interfere with the ability of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves against violent criminals." [59] Constitutions in 37 US states protect the right to bear arms for self-defense, most with explicit language such as Alabama's: "every citizen has a right to bear arms in defense of himself and the state." [60] [61] Wayne LaPierre, Executive Vice President of the NRA, stated, "The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." [62] A May 9, 2013 48% of convicted felons surveyed admitted that they avoided committing crimes when they knew the victim was armed with a gun. [63] Pew Foundation report found that 79% of male gun owners and 80% of female gun owners said owning a gun made them feel safer and 64% of people living in a home in which someone else owns a gun felt safer. [58] Even Senator Dianne Feinstein, a gun control advocate, carried a concealed gun when her life was threatened and her home attacked by the New World Liberation Front in the 1970s. [64]
Gun control laws, especially those that try to ban "assault weapons," infringe upon the right to own guns for hunting and sport. In 2011, there were 13.7 million hunters 16 years old or older in the United States, and they spent $7.7 billion on guns, sights, ammunition, and other hunting equipment. [65] [66] High-powered semiautomatic rifles and shotguns are used to hunt and in target shooting tournaments each year. [67] According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, "So-called 'Assault weapons' are more often than not less powerful than other hunting rifles. The term 'assault weapon' was conjured up by anti-gun legislators to scare voters into thinking these firearms are something out of a horror movie… [T]he Colt AR-15 and Springfield M1A, both labeled 'assault weapons,' are the rifles most used for marksmanship competitions in the United States. And their cartridges are standard hunting calibers, useful for game up to and including deer." [68] According to a Feb. 2013 Pew Research report, 32% of gun owners owned guns for hunting and 7% owned guns for target or sport shooting. [58]
Gun control laws will not prevent criminals from obtaining guns or breaking laws. Of 62 mass shootings in the United States between 1982 and 2012, 49 of the shooters used legally obtained guns. Collectively, 143 guns were possessed by the killers with about 75% obtained legally. [69] John R. Lott, Jr., PhD, gun rights activist, stated, "The problem with such [gun control] laws is that they take away guns from law-abiding citizens, while would-be criminals ignore them." [70] According to a Bureau of Justice Statistics May 2013 report, 37.4% of state prison inmates who "used, carried, or possessed a firearm when they committed the crime for which they were serving a prison sentence" obtained the gun from a family member or friend. [16] Despite Chicago's ban on gun shops, shooting ranges, assault weapons, and high capacity magazines, in 2014 Chicago had 2,089 shooting victims including at least 390 murders. [71] [72] [73] Approximately 50,000 guns were recovered by police in Chicago between 2001 and Mar. 2012. The guns came from all 50 states, and more than half came from outside of Illinois. [74]
Gun control laws give too much power to the government and may result in government tyranny and the government taking away all guns from citizens. 57% of people surveyed by Pew Research in Feb. 2013 said that gun control laws would "give too much power to the government over the people." [58] The NRA's Wayne LaPierre stated, "if you look at why our Founding Fathers put it [the Second Amendment] there, they had lived under the tyranny of King George and they wanted to make sure that these free people in this new country would never be subjugated again and have to live under tyranny." [75] Alex Jones, radio host, in a Jan 7, 2013 interview with Piers Morgan, stated, "The Second Amendment isn't there for duck hunting, it's there to protect us from tyrannical government and street thugs… 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!" [76]
Gun control laws such as background checks and micro-stamping are an invasion of privacy. Background checks would require government databases that keep personal individual information on gun owners, including name, addresses, mental health history, criminal records, and more. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) worried that Senator Harry Reid's 2013 proposed background check legislation (the bill failed 54-46) would have allowed the government to keep databases of gun purchases indefinitely, creating a "worry that you're going to see searches of the databases and an expansion for purposes that were not intended when the information was collected." [77] [78] Micro-stamping similarly requires a database of gun owners and the codes their personal guns would stamp on cartridge cases. [79] Senators Rand Paul (R-KY), Mike Lee (R-UT), and Ted Cruz (R-TX) wrote that they would oppose any legislation that infringes "on the American people's constitutional right to bear arms, or on their ability to exercise this right without being subjected to government surveillance." [80]
More gun control is unnecessary because relatively few people are killed by guns. According to the CDC's "Leading Causes of Death Reports," between 1999 and 2013, Americans were 21.5 times more likely to die of heart disease (9,691,733 deaths); 18.7 times more likely to die of malignant tumors (8,458,868 deaths); and 2.4 times more likely to die of diabetes or 2.3 times more likely to die of Alzheimer's (1,080,298 and 1,053,207 respectively) than to die from a firearm (whether by accident, homicide, or suicide). [4] The flu and related pneumonia (875,143 deaths); traffic accidents (594,280 deaths); and poisoning whether via accident, homicide, or suicide (475,907 deaths) all killed more people between 1999 and 2013 than firearms. [4] Firearms were the 12th leading cause of deaths for all deaths between 1999 and 2013, responsible for 1.3% of deaths with 464,033 deaths. [4] Internationally, the claim that the United States has a major problem with firearm homicide is exaggerated. The United States is ranked 28 in international homicide rates with 2.97 gun murders per 100,000 people in 2012. [89]
Gun control laws and lower gun ownership rates do not prevent suicides. Lithuania has one of the world's lowest gun ownership rates (0.7 guns per 100 people) but its suicide rate (by any method) was 45.06 per 100,000 people in 1999, the highest suicide rate among 71 countries with available information. [44] Japan has a low gun ownership rate at 0.6 guns per 100 people and a high suicide rate of 18.41 suicides per 100,000 people in 1997 (ranking it 11 out of 71 countries). [44] [45] South Korea has a low gun ownership rate (1.1 guns per 100 people) but has a high rate of suicide and the highest rate of gun suicides (12.63 per 100,000 people in 1997). [44] [45] By contrast the United States has the 26th highest suicide rate (12.3 suicides per 100,000 people in 2011) and the highest gun ownership rate (88.8 guns per 100 people). [44] [45] Jim Barrett, author for TheTruthAboutGuns.com, stated, "the theory that the restriction or elimination of guns would have a positive effect on the overall suicide rate in the U.S. does not hold up under scrutiny." [81]
More gun control is not needed; education about guns and gun safety is needed to prevent accidental gun deaths. 95% of all US gun owners believe that children should learn about gun safety. [154] Guns don't kill people; people kill people. And people need more gun education and mental illness screening to prevent massacres.The Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute, Inc (SAAMI), stated, "Whether in the field, at the range or in the home, a responsible and knowledgeable gun owner is rarely involved in a firearms accident of any kind." [82] Heidi Cifelli, Former Program Manager of the NRA's Eddie Eagle GunSafe Program, stated, "Gun education is the best way to save young lives." [83] The NRA states that the Eddie Eagle program is not meant to "teach whether guns are good or bad, but rather to promote the protection and safety of children… Like swimming pools, electrical outlets, matchbooks, and household poison, they're [guns] treated simply as a fact of everyday life." [84] According to Kyle Wintersteen, Managing Editor of Guns and Ammo, studies show that "children taught about firearms and their legitimate uses by family members have much lower rates of delinquency than children in households without guns" and "children introduced to guns associate them with freedom, security, and recreation—not violence." [85]
Gun control laws would prevent citizens from protecting themselves from foreign invaders. The Libertarian Party stated, "A responsible, well-armed and trained citizenry is the best protection against domestic crime and the threat of foreign invasion." [86] Counsel for the NRA stated, "It is evident that the framers of the Constitution did not intend to limit the right to keep and bear arms to a formal military body or organized militia, but intended to provide for an 'unorganized' armed citizenry prepared to assist in the common defense against a foreign invader or a domestic tyrant." [87] Marco Rubio (R-FL), US Senator, speaking about gun control laws during his 2016 presidential campaign, stated, "If God forbid, ISIS visits our life, our neighborhood, our school, any part of us, the last thing standing, the last line of defense could very well be our ability to protect ourselves." [149]
Strict gun control laws do not work in Mexico, and will not work in the United States. Mexico has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world and yet, in 2012, Mexico had 11,309 gun murders (9.97 gun homicides per 100,000 people) compared to the United States that had 9,146 gun homicides (2.97 per 100,000 people). [88] [89]. The country has only one legal gun store (the Directorate of Arms and Munitions Sales), compared to at least 63,709 legal gun stores and pawn shops in the United States as of Feb. 10, 2014. [90] [91] Mexico's gun store is on a secure military base and customers must present a valid ID, go through a metal detector, and turn over cellphones and cameras to guards. To actually buy a gun, customers have to show proof of honest income, provide references, pass a criminal background check, prove any military duties were completed with honor, and be fingerprinted and photographed. If allowed to purchase a gun, the customer may buy only one gun (choosing from only .38 caliber pistols or lower) and one box of bullets. [90] [92] [93] Between 2006 and 2010, Mexico's one gun shop sold 6,490 guns, [92] yet as of 2012, Mexicans own about 15,000,000 guns, or about 13.5 guns per 100 people. [44]
Gun control laws are racist. Current gun control laws are frequently aimed at inner city, poor, black communities who are perceived as more dangerous than white gun owners. [94] [95] Charles Gallagher, MA, PhD, the Chair of Sociology at LaSalle University, stated that some gun control laws are still founded on racial fears: "Whites walking down Main Street with an AK-47 are defenders of American values; a black man doing the same thing is Public Enemy No. 1." [96] In the late 1960s, gun control laws were enacted in reaction to the militant, gun-carrying Black Panthers. [97] Adam Winkler, MA, JD, UCLA Constitutional Law Professor, stated "The KKK began as a gun-control organization. Before the Civil War, blacks were never allowed to own guns" so, after the Civil War, there was "constant pressure among white racists to keep guns out of the hands of African Americans because they would rise up and revolt.” [97] In Virginia, in response to Nat Turner's Rebellion (also called the Southampton Rebellion, in which slaves killed 55 to 65 people in the most fatal slave uprising in the United States) in 1831, a law was passed that prohibited free black people "to keep or carry any firelock of any kind, any military weapon, or any powder or lead and all laws allowing free black people to possess firearms were repealed. [98].
The Second Amendment was intended to protect gun ownership of all able-bodied men so that they could participate in the militia to keep the peace and defend the country if needed. According to the United States Code, a "militia" is composed of all "able-bodied males at least 17 years of age… under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard." [99] Therefore, the militia mentioned in the Second Amendment would have been composed of almost all adult men and, in turn, that most adult men should not have their right to own firearms infringed. [100] A 1792 federal law required that every man eligible for militia service own a gun and ammunition suitable for military service, report for frequent inspection of their guns, and register their gun ownership on public records. [101] Daniel J. Schultz, lawyer, stated, "the Framers [of the Constitution and Bill of Rights] understood that 'well-regulated' militias, that is, armed citizens, ready to form militias that would be well trained, self-regulated and disciplined would post no threat to their fellow citizens, but would, indeed, help to 'insure domestic Tranquility' and 'provide for the common defence.'" [100]
Gun control efforts have proved ineffective. According to David Lampo, Publications Director of the Cato Institute, "there is no correlation between waiting periods and murder or robbery rates." [102] Banning high-capacity magazines will not necessarily deter crime because even small gun magazines can be changed in seconds.The "gun show loophole" is virtually nonexistent because commercial dealers, who sell the majority of guns at shows and elsewhere, are bound by strict federal laws. [102] According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates, and, of 25 state laws, nine were associated with higher gun death rates. [148]

The Second Amendment is not an unlimited right to own guns.
Gun control laws are just as old or older than the Second Amendment (ratified in 1791). Some examples of gun control throughout colonial America included criminalizing the transfer of guns to Catholics, slaves, indentured servants, and Native Americans; regulating the storage of gun powder in homes; banning loaded guns in Boston houses; and mandating participation in formal gathering of troops and door-to-door surveys about guns owned. [1] [2] In the June 26, 2008 District of Columbia et al. v. Heller US Supreme Court majority opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia, LLB, wrote, "Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited… nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms." [3] On June 9, 2016 the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 7-4 that "[t]he right of the general public to carry a concealed firearm in public is not, and never has been, protected by the Second Amendment," thus upholding a law requiring a permitting process and "good cause" for concealed carry licenses in California. [145] [146] A 2018 study found that 91% of the 1,153 court cases with claims stating a government action or law violates the Second Amendment between the 2008 DC v. Heller decision and Feb. 1, 2016 failed. [157]

There were 464,033 total gun deaths between 1999 and 2013: 270,237 suicides (58.2% of total deaths); 174,773 homicides (37.7%); and 9,983 unintentional deaths (2.2%). [4] Guns were the leading cause of death by homicide (66.6% of all homicides) and by suicide (52.2% of all suicides). [4] David Frum, Daily Beast and CNN contributor, stated, "American children under age 15 were nine times more likely to die of a gun accident than children in other advanced wealthy countries… About 200 Americans go to emergency rooms every day with gunshot wounds." [5] A study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that "legal purchase of a handgun appears to be associated with a long-lasting increased risk of violent death" [6] According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, implementing federal universal background checks could reduce firearm deaths by a projected 56.9%; background checks for ammunition purchases could reduce deaths by a projected 80.7%; and gun identification requirements could reduce deaths by a projected 82.5%. [148] Gun licensing laws were associated with a 14% decrease in firearm homicides, while increases in firearm homicides were seen in places with right-to-carry and stand-your ground-laws. [148] [160]

High-capacity magazines should be banned because they too often turn murder into mass murder.
A Mother Jones investigation found that high-capacity magazines were used in at least 50% of the 62 mass shootings between 1982 and 2012. [7] When high-capacity magazines were used in mass shootings, the death rate rose 63% and the injury rate rose 156%. [8] David H. Chipman, Senior Vice President of Public Safety for ShotSpotter and former Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) agent, stated that a high-capacity magazine "turns a killer into a killing machine." [7] Some gang members use high-capacity magazines, such as 30 rounds or even 90 rounds, to compensate for lack of accuracy and maximize the chance to harm. [9]

More gun control laws are needed to protect women from domestic abusers and stalkers.
Five women are murdered with guns every day in the United States. [10] A woman's risk of being murdered increases 500% if a gun is present during a domestic dispute. [11] During the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, 5,364 US soldiers were killed in action between Oct. 7, 2001 and Jan. 28, 2015; between 2001 and 2012 6,410 women were killed with a gun by an intimate partner in the United States. [10] [12] A 2003 study of 23 populous high-income countries found that 86% of women killed by firearms were in the United States and American women are 11.4 times more likely to be the victims of gun homicides [13] 57% of mass shootings involved domestic violence. [11] [14] For example, the 2011 mass shooting at a Seal Beach, CA hair salon reportedly began because of the shooter's custody battle with his ex-wife who was a hair stylist at the salon. [11] [8] 31 states do not ban convicted misdemeanor stalkers from owning guns and 41 states do not force convicted domestic abusers from relinquishing guns they already own. [10] [14] 76% of women murdered and 85% of women who survived a murder attempt by an intimate partner were stalked in the year before the murder or murder attempt. [15]

[16] In 2010 there were 230 "justifiable homicides" in which a private citizen used a firearm to kill a felon, compared to 8,275 criminal gun homicides (or, 36 criminal homicides for every "justifiable homicide"). [17] Of the 84,495,500 property crimes committed between 2007 and 2011, 0.12% of victims (103,000) protected themselves with a threat of use or use of a firearm. [16]

Legally owned guns are frequently stolen and used by criminals.
A June 2013 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report states that "[a]lmost all guns used in criminal acts enter circulation via initial legal transaction." [18] Between 2005 and 2010, 1.4 million guns were stolen from US homes during property crimes (including burglary and car theft), a yearly average of 232,400. [19] Ian Ayres, JD, PhD, and John J. Donohue, JD, PhD, Professors of Law at Yale Law School and Stanford Law School respectively, state, "with guns being a product that can be easily carried away and quickly sold at a relatively high fraction of the initial cost, the presence of more guns can actually serve as a stimulus to burglary and theft. Even if the gun owner had a permit to carry a concealed weapon and would never use it in furtherance of a crime, is it likely that the same can be said for the burglar who steals the gun?" [20]

Gun control laws would reduce the societal costs associated with gun violence.
According to the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation (PIRE), in 2010, gun violence cost each person in the United States roughly $564 and the US government $5.5 billion in lost tax revenue; $4.7 billion in court costs; $1.4 billion in Medicare and Medicaid costs; $180 million in mental health care for victims; $224 million in insurance claims processing; and $133 million for law enforcement and medic response to shooting injuries. [21] [22] In 2010, there were 36,341 emergency room visits and 25,024 hospitalizations for gun injuries, costing an estimated $6.3 million. [23] 84% of those injured by firearms are uninsured, leaving taxpayers responsible for most of those bills through programs like Medicaid. [23] [24] [25] [26] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the costs of gun violence can include legal services, medical costs, perpetrator control, policing, incarceration, foster care, private security, lost earnings and time, life insurance, productivity, tourism, and psychological costs (pain and suffering), among others. [25] Homicide rates doubling has been associated with a 12.5% decline in property values. [25]

A majority of adults, including gun owners, support common sense gun control such as background checks, bans on assault weapons, and bans on high-capacity magazines.
According to a Feb. 20, 2018 Quinnipiac Poll, 97% of American voters and 97% of gun owners support universal background checks. 67% support a nationwide ban on assault weapons, and 83% support mandatory waiting periods for gun purchases. [155] As much as 40% of all gun sales are undocumented private party gun sales that do not require a background check (aka the "gun show loophole"). [28] 56% of all adults surveyed approve of assault weapon bans and 53% of all adults surveyed approve of high-capacity magazine bans. [27] 89% of adults with a gun in the home approve of laws to prevent the purchase of guns by the mentally ill, and 82% approve of banning gun sales to people on no-fly lists. [27]Don Macalady, member of Hunters against Gun Violence, stated, "As a hunter and someone who has owned guns since I was a young boy, I believe that commonsense gun legislation makes us all safer.

More gun control leads to fewer suicides.
Between 1999 and 2013 there were 270,237 firearm suicides in the United States, accounting for about 52% of all suicides during those years. [4] According to a Mar. 2014 study, when gun ownership went down in the United States, overall suicide rates went down. [30] [31] Firearm-related suicides accounted for 61% of the gun deaths in the United States between 2000 and 2010. [18] A Dec. 2009 study found "general barrier to firearm access created through state regulation can have a significant deterrent effect on male suicide rates in the United States. Permit requirements and bans on sales to minors were the most effective of the regulations analyzed." [32] In Indiana and Connecticut, after "red flag" laws to remove guns from people who may pose a threat were enacted, gun suicides decreased by 7.5% and 13.7% respectively, while suicides by other means did not decrease during the same time. [158] [159] A person who wants to kill him/herself is unlikely to commit suicide with poison or a knife when a gun is unavailable. [33]

Enacting gun control laws such as mandatory safety features would reduce the number of accidental gun deaths.
Approximately 50% of unintentional fatal shootings were self-inflicted; and most unintentional firearm deaths were caused by friends or family members. [18] [4] According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the National Physicians Alliance, states with the highest concentration of guns have nine times the amount of accidental gun deaths and "89% of unintentional shooting deaths of children occur in the home—and most of these deaths occur when children are playing with a loaded gun in their parents’ absence." [34] The US General Accountability Office (GAO) estimated that 31% of total accidental shooting deaths could have been prevented by installing safety devices on guns: 100% of deaths per year in which a child under 6 years old shoots and kills him/herself or another child could be prevented by automatic child-proof safety locks; and 23% of accidental shooting deaths by adolescents and adults per year could be prevented by loading indicators showing when a bullet was in the chamber ready to be fired. [35] Marjorie Sanfilippo, PhD, Professor of Psychology at Eckerd College who has researched children’s behavior around guns, stated, "We put gates around swimming pools to keep children from drowning. We put safety caps on medications to keep children from poisoning themselves… [B]ecause children are naturally curious and impulsive, and because we have shown time and again that we cannot 'gun-proof' them with education, we have a responsibility to keep guns out of the hands of children."

The presence of a gun makes a conflict more likely to become violent.
The FBI found that in 2013 arguments (such as romantic triangles, brawls fueled by alcohol or drugs, and arguments over money) resulted in 1,962 gun deaths (59.9% of the total). [37] A June 1985 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that "the weapons used [in altercations]… were those closest at hand." [38] An editorial published in the June 1985 American Journal of Public Health noted, "gun-inflicted deaths [often] ensue from impromptu arguments and fights; in the US, two-thirds of the 7,900 deaths in 1981 involving arguments and brawls were caused by guns." [39] A 1993 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that "[r]ather than confer protection, guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance."

Armed civilians are unlikely to stop crimes and are more likely to make dangerous situations, including mass shootings, more deadly.
None of the 62 mass shootings between 1982 and 2012 was stopped by an armed civilian. [41] Gun rights activists regularly state that a 2002 mass shooting at the Appalachian School of Law in Virginia was stopped by armed students, but those students were current and former law enforcement officers and the killer was out of bullets when subdued. [41] Other mass shootings often held up as examples of armed citizens being able to stop mass shootings involved law enforcement or military personnel and/or the shooter had stopped shooting before being subdued, such as a 1997 high school shooting in Pearl, MS; a 1998 middle school dance shooting in Edinboro, PA; a 2007 church shooting in Colorado Springs, CO; and a 2008 bar shooting in Winnemucca, NV. [42] Jeffrey Voccola, Assistant Professor of Writing at Kutztown University, notes, "The average gun owner, no matter how responsible, is not trained in law enforcement or on how to handle life-threatening situations, so in most cases, if a threat occurs, increasing the number of guns only creates a more volatile and dangerous situation."

[44] In 2007 Switzerland ranked number 3 in international gun ownership rates with 45.7 guns per 100 people (about 3,400,000 guns total). [45] In 2009 Switzerland had 24 gun homicides (0.31 deaths per 100,000 people) and 253 gun suicides (3.29 deaths per 100,000 people). [44] Finland ranked fourth in international gun ownership rates with 45.3 guns per 100 people (about 2,400,000 guns total). [45] In 2007 Finland had 23 (0.43 deaths per 100,000 people) gun homicides and 172 gun suicides (4.19 deaths per 100,000 people). [44] The United States, categorized as having "permissive" firearm regulation by GunPolicy.org, ranked first in international gun ownership rates with 88.8 guns per 100 people (about 270,000,000 guns total). [44] [45] In 2007 the United States had 12,632 gun homicides (4.19 deaths per 100,000 people) and 17,352 gun suicides (5.76 deaths per 100,000 people). [44] [4] Harvard professor David Hemenway, PhD, wrote "We analyzed the relationship between homicide and gun availability using data from 26 developed countries from the early 1990s. We found that across developed countries, where guns are more available, there are more homicides." [46] According to a Mar. 2016 study, gun homicide rates in the United States were 25.3 times higher and gun suicides were 8 times higher in 2010 than in other populous, high-income countries. Additionally, 90% of women, 91% of 0- to 14-year olds, 92% of 15- to 24-year-olds, and 82% of all people killed by firearms were from the United States. [147]

The Second Amendment was intended to protect the right of militias to own guns, not the right of individuals.
Former Justice John Paul Stevens, JD, in his dissenting opinion for District of Columbia et al. v. Heller, wrote, "the Framer's single-minded focus in crafting the constitutional guarantee 'to keep and bear arms' was on military use of firearms, which they viewed in the context of service in state militias," hence the inclusion of the phrase "well regulated militia." [3] Michael Waldman, JD, President of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, stated there is nothing about an individual right to bear arms in the notes about the Second Amendment when it was being drafted, discussed, or ratified; the US Supreme Court declined to rule in favor of the individual right four times between 1876 and 1939; and all law articles on the Second Amendment from 1888 to 1959 stated that an individual right was not guaranteed.

Civilians, including hunters, should not own military-grade firearms or firearm accessories.
President Ronald Reagan and others did not think the AR-15 military rifle (also called M16s by the Air Force) should be owned by civilians and, when the AR-15 was included in the assault weapons ban of 1994 (which expired on Sep. 13, 2004), the NRA supported the legislation. [48] The Second Amendment was written at a time when the most common arms were long rifles that had to be reloaded after every shot. Civilians today have access to folding, detaching, or telescoping stocks that make the guns more easily concealed and carried; silencers to muffle gunshot sounds; flash suppressors to fire in low-light conditions without being blinded by the flash and to conceals the shooter’s location; or grenade launcher attachments. [49] Jonathan Lowy, Director of Legal Action Project at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, stated, "These are weapons that will shred your venison before you eat it, or go through the walls of your apartment when you’re trying to defend yourself… [they are] made for mass killing, but not useful for law-abiding citizens."

The Second Amendment of the US Constitution protects individual gun ownership.
The Second Amendment of the US Constitution reads, "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed." Gun ownership is an American tradition older than the country itself and is protected by the Second Amendment; more gun control laws would infringe upon the right to bear arms. Justice Antonin Scalia, LLB, in the June 26, 2008 District of Columbia et al. v. Heller US Supreme Court majority opinion syllabus stated, "The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home." [3] The McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010) ruling also stated that the Second Amendment is an individual right. [51] Lawrence Hunter, Chairman of Revolution PAC, stated, "The Founders understood that the right to own and bear laws is as fundamental and as essential to maintaining liberty as are the rights of free speech, a free press, freedom of religion and the other protections against government encroachments on liberty delineated in the Bill of Rights."

Gun control laws do not deter crime; gun ownership deters crime.
A Nov. 26, 2013 study found that, between 1980 and 2009, "assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level" and "states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders." [103] While gun ownership doubled in the twentieth century, the murder rate decreased. [53] John R. Lott, Jr., PhD, author of More Guns, Less Crime: Understanding Crime and Gun Control Laws, stated, "States with the largest increases in gun ownership also have the largest drops in violent crimes... The effect on 'shall-issue' [concealed gun] laws on these crimes [where two or more people were killed] has been dramatic. When states passed these laws, the number of multiple-victim shootings declined by 84 percent. Deaths from these shootings plummeted on average by 90 percent and injuries by 82 percent." [54] A Dec. 10, 2014 Pew survey found that 57% of people believe that owning a gun protects them from being victimized. [55] Journalist John Stossel explained, "Criminals don't obey the law… Without the fear of retaliation from victims who might be packing heat, criminals in possession of these [illegal] weapons now have a much easier job... As the saying goes, 'If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.'" [56]

Gun control laws infringe upon the right to self-defense and deny people a sense of safety.
According to the National Rifle Association (NRA), guns are used for self-defense 2.5 million times a year. [57] The police cannot protect everyone all of the time. 61% of men and 56% of women surveyed by Pew Research said that stricter gun laws would "make it more difficult for people to protect their homes and families." [58] Nelson Lund, JD, PhD, Professor at George Mason University School of Law, stated, "The right to self-defense and to the means of defending oneself is a basic natural right that grows out of the right to life" and "many [gun control laws] interfere with the ability of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves against violent criminals." [59] Constitutions in 37 US states protect the right to bear arms for self-defense, most with explicit language such as Alabama's: "every citizen has a right to bear arms in defense of himself and the state." [60] [61] Wayne LaPierre, Executive Vice President of the NRA, stated, "The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." [62] A May 9, 2013 48% of convicted felons surveyed admitted that they avoided committing crimes when they knew the victim was armed with a gun. [63] Pew Foundation report found that 79% of male gun owners and 80% of female gun owners said owning a gun made them feel safer and 64% of people living in a home in which someone else owns a gun felt safer. [58] Even Senator Dianne Feinstein, a gun control advocate, carried a concealed gun when her life was threatened and her home attacked by the New World Liberation Front in the 1970s. [64]

Gun control laws, especially those that try to ban "assault weapons," infringe upon the right to own guns for hunting and sport.
In 2011, there were 13.7 million hunters 16 years old or older in the United States, and they spent $7.7 billion on guns, sights, ammunition, and other hunting equipment. [65] [66] High-powered semiautomatic rifles and shotguns are used to hunt and in target shooting tournaments each year. [67] According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, "So-called 'Assault weapons' are more often than not less powerful than other hunting rifles. The term 'assault weapon' was conjured up by anti-gun legislators to scare voters into thinking these firearms are something out of a horror movie… [T]he Colt AR-15 and Springfield M1A, both labeled 'assault weapons,' are the rifles most used for marksmanship competitions in the United States. And their cartridges are standard hunting calibers, useful for game up to and including deer." [68] According to a Feb. 2013 Pew Research report, 32% of gun owners owned guns for hunting and 7% owned guns for target or sport shooting. [58]

Gun control laws will not prevent criminals from obtaining guns or breaking laws.
Of 62 mass shootings in the United States between 1982 and 2012, 49 of the shooters used legally obtained guns. Collectively, 143 guns were possessed by the killers with about 75% obtained legally. [69] John R. Lott, Jr., PhD, gun rights activist, stated, "The problem with such [gun control] laws is that they take away guns from law-abiding citizens, while would-be criminals ignore them." [70] According to a Bureau of Justice Statistics May 2013 report, 37.4% of state prison inmates who "used, carried, or possessed a firearm when they committed the crime for which they were serving a prison sentence" obtained the gun from a family member or friend. [16] Despite Chicago's ban on gun shops, shooting ranges, assault weapons, and high capacity magazines, in 2014 Chicago had 2,089 shooting victims including at least 390 murders. [71] [72] [73] Approximately 50,000 guns were recovered by police in Chicago between 2001 and Mar. 2012. The guns came from all 50 states, and more than half came from outside of Illinois. [74]

57% of people surveyed by Pew Research in Feb. 2013 said that gun control laws would "give too much power to the government over the people." [58] The NRA's Wayne LaPierre stated, "if you look at why our Founding Fathers put it [the Second Amendment] there, they had lived under the tyranny of King George and they wanted to make sure that these free people in this new country would never be subjugated again and have to live under tyranny." [75] Alex Jones, radio host, in a Jan 7, 2013 interview with Piers Morgan, stated, "The Second Amendment isn't there for duck hunting, it's there to protect us from tyrannical government and street thugs… 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!"

Gun control laws such as background checks and micro-stamping are an invasion of privacy.
Background checks would require government databases that keep personal individual information on gun owners, including name, addresses, mental health history, criminal records, and more. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) worried that Senator Harry Reid's 2013 proposed background check legislation (the bill failed 54-46) would have allowed the government to keep databases of gun purchases indefinitely, creating a "worry that you're going to see searches of the databases and an expansion for purposes that were not intended when the information was collected." [77] [78] Micro-stamping similarly requires a database of gun owners and the codes their personal guns would stamp on cartridge cases. [79] Senators Rand Paul (R-KY), Mike Lee (R-UT), and Ted Cruz (R-TX) wrote that they would oppose any legislation that infringes "on the American people's constitutional right to bear arms, or on their ability to exercise this right without being subjected to government surveillance."

More gun control is unnecessary because relatively few people are killed by guns.
According to the CDC's "Leading Causes of Death Reports," between 1999 and 2013, Americans were 21.5 times more likely to die of heart disease (9,691,733 deaths); 18.7 times more likely to die of malignant tumors (8,458,868 deaths); and 2.4 times more likely to die of diabetes or 2.3 times more likely to die of Alzheimer's (1,080,298 and 1,053,207 respectively) than to die from a firearm (whether by accident, homicide, or suicide). [4] The flu and related pneumonia (875,143 deaths); traffic accidents (594,280 deaths); and poisoning whether via accident, homicide, or suicide (475,907 deaths) all killed more people between 1999 and 2013 than firearms. [4] Firearms were the 12th leading cause of deaths for all deaths between 1999 and 2013, responsible for 1.3% of deaths with 464,033 deaths. [4 ]Internationally, the claim that the United States has a major problem with firearm homicide is exaggerated. The United States is ranked 28 in international homicide rates with 2.97 gun murders per 100,000 people in 2012.[89]

[44] Japan has a low gun ownership rate at 0.6 guns per 100 people and a high suicide rate of 18.41 suicides per 100,000 people in 1997 (ranking it 11 out of 71 countries). [44] [45] South Korea has a low gun ownership rate (1.1 guns per 100 people) but has a high rate of suicide and the highest rate of gun suicides (12.63 per 100,000 people in 1997). [44] [45] By contrast the United States has the 26th highest suicide rate (12.3 suicides per 100,000 people in 2011) and the highest gun ownership rate (88.8 guns per 100 people). [44] [45] Jim Barrett, author for TheTruthAboutGuns.com, stated, "the theory that the restriction or elimination of guns would have a positive effect on the overall suicide rate in the U.S. does not hold up under scrutiny."

More gun control is not needed; education about guns and gun safety is needed to prevent accidental gun deaths.
95% of all US gun owners believe that children should learn about gun safety. [154] Guns don't kill people; people kill people. And people need more gun education and mental illness screening to prevent massacres.The Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute, Inc (SAAMI), stated, "Whether in the field, at the range or in the home, a responsible and knowledgeable gun owner is rarely involved in a firearms accident of any kind." [82] Heidi Cifelli, Former Program Manager of the NRA's Eddie Eagle GunSafe Program, stated, "Gun education is the best way to save young lives." [83] The NRA states that the Eddie Eagle program is not meant to "teach whether guns are good or bad, but rather to promote the protection and safety of children… Like swimming pools, electrical outlets, matchbooks, and household poison, they're [guns] treated simply as a fact of everyday life." [84] According to Kyle Wintersteen, Managing Editor of Guns and Ammo, studies show that "children taught about firearms and their legitimate uses by family members have much lower rates of delinquency than children in households without guns" and "children introduced to guns associate them with freedom, security, and recreation—not violence."

The Libertarian Party stated, "A responsible, well-armed and trained citizenry is the best protection against domestic crime and the threat of foreign invasion." [86] Counsel for the NRA stated, "It is evident that the framers of the Constitution did not intend to limit the right to keep and bear arms to a formal military body or organized militia, but intended to provide for an 'unorganized' armed citizenry prepared to assist in the common defense against a foreign invader or a domestic tyrant." [87] Marco Rubio (R-FL), US Senator, speaking about gun control laws during his 2016 presidential campaign, stated, "If God forbid, ISIS visits our life, our neighborhood, our school, any part of us, the last thing standing, the last line of defense could very well be our ability to protect ourselves."

Mexico has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world and yet, in 2012, Mexico had 11,309 gun murders (9.97 gun homicides per 100,000 people) compared to the United States that had 9,146 gun homicides (2.97 per 100,000 people). [88] [89]. The country has only one legal gun store (the Directorate of Arms and Munitions Sales), compared to at least 63,709 legal gun stores and pawn shops in the United States as of Feb. 10, 2014. [90] [91] Mexico's gun store is on a secure military base and customers must present a valid ID, go through a metal detector, and turn over cellphones and cameras to guards. To actually buy a gun, customers have to show proof of honest income, provide references, pass a criminal background check, prove any military duties were completed with honor, and be fingerprinted and photographed. If allowed to purchase a gun, the customer may buy only one gun (choosing from only .38 caliber pistols or lower) and one box of bullets. [90] [92] [93] Between 2006 and 2010, Mexico's one gun shop sold 6,490 guns, [92] yet as of 2012, Mexicans own about 15,000,000 guns, or about 13.5 guns per 100 people. [44]

Gun control laws are racist.
Current gun control laws are frequently aimed at inner city, poor, black communities who are perceived as more dangerous than white gun owners. [94] [95] Charles Gallagher, MA, PhD, the Chair of Sociology at LaSalle University, stated that some gun control laws are still founded on racial fears: "Whites walking down Main Street with an AK-47 are defenders of American values; a black man doing the same thing is Public Enemy No. 1." [96] In the late 1960s, gun control laws were enacted in reaction to the militant, gun-carrying Black Panthers. [97] Adam Winkler, MA, JD, UCLA Constitutional Law Professor, stated "The KKK began as a gun-control organization. Before the Civil War, blacks were never allowed to own guns" so, after the Civil War, there was "constant pressure among white racists to keep guns out of the hands of African Americans because they would rise up and revolt.” [97] In Virginia, in response to Nat Turner's Rebellion (also called the Southampton Rebellion, in which slaves killed 55 to 65 people in the most fatal slave uprising in the United States) in 1831, a law was passed that prohibited free black people "to keep or carry any firelock of any kind, any military weapon, or any powder or lead and all laws allowing free black people to possess firearms were repealed. [98].

The Second Amendment was intended to protect gun ownership of all able-bodied men so that they could participate in the militia to keep the peace and defend the country if needed.
According to the United States Code, a "militia" is composed of all "able-bodied males at least 17 years of age… under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard." [99] Therefore, the militia mentioned in the Second Amendment would have been composed of almost all adult men and, in turn, that most adult men should not have their right to own firearms infringed. [100] A 1792 federal law required that every man eligible for militia service own a gun and ammunition suitable for military service, report for frequent inspection of their guns, and register their gun ownership on public records. [101] Daniel J. Schultz, lawyer, stated, "the Framers [of the Constitution and Bill of Rights] understood that 'well-regulated' militias, that is, armed citizens, ready to form militias that would be well trained, self-regulated and disciplined would post no threat to their fellow citizens, but would, indeed, help to 'insure domestic Tranquility' and 'provide for the common defence.'"

Gun control efforts have proved ineffective.
According to David Lampo, Publications Director of the Cato Institute, "there is no correlation between waiting periods and murder or robbery rates." [102] Banning high-capacity magazines will not necessarily deter crime because even small gun magazines can be changed in seconds.The "gun show loophole" is virtually nonexistent because commercial dealers, who sell the majority of guns at shows and elsewhere, are bound by strict federal laws. [102] According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates, and, of 25 state laws, nine were associated with higher gun death rates. [148]

The US General Accountability Office (GAO) estimated that 100% of deaths per year in which a child under 6 years old shoots and kills him/herself or another child could be prevented by automatic child-proof safety locks. [35]
The Centers for Disease Control listed firearms as the #12 cause of all deaths between 1999 and 2015, representing 1.3% of total deaths. They were also the #1 method of death by homicide (67.3% of all homicides) and by suicide (51.9% of all suicides). [4]
Mexico has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world and yet, in 2012, Mexico had 11,309 gun murders (9.97 gun homicides per 100,000 people) compared to the United States that had 9,146 gun homicides (2.97 per 100,000 people). [88] [89]

NEW ProCon.org Website! – Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?
3/31/2016 - Our 55th website explores the pros and cons in the debate over increasing the minimum wage. The federal minimum wage was introduced in the 1930s by President Roosevelt and has been increased by Congress 22 times, most recently in 2009 to reach its current level of $7.25 an hour. Proponents say the current federal minimum wage is too low for anyone to live on; and that a higher minimum wage will help create jobs, grow the economy, and decrease wage inequality. Opponents say that many businesses cannot afford to pay their workers more and will be forced to close, lay off workers, and reduce hiring; that an increase makes it more difficult for low-skilled workers with little or no experience to find jobs; and that low-income communities are disproportionately harmed by wage raises at the federal level.

NEW ProCon.org Website - "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted in the United States?"
6/19/2015 - NEW ProCon.org Website - "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted in the United States?" - The tragic shooting event in Charleston has reignited the national debate over gun control. After several months of research, ProCon.org announces its new website exploring the pros and cons of gun control from a nonpartisan perspective.
The 53rd website from ProCon.org examines the core question "Should more gun control laws be enacted in the United States?"
Proponents of more gun control laws state that the Second Amendment was intended for militias; that deadly, senseless, and costly gun violence would be reduced; and that a majority of Americans, including gun owners, support new gun restrictions. Opponents say that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to own guns; that guns are needed for self-defense from threats ranging from local criminals to foreign invaders; and that gun ownership deters crime rather than causes more crime.

Almost one in five US public schools required students to wear uniforms during the 2011-2012 school year, up from one in eight in 2003-2004. Proponents say that school uniforms make schools safer for students, create a "level playing field" that reduces socioeconomic disparities, and encourage children to focus on their studies rather than their clothes. Opponents say school uniforms infringe upon students' right to express their individuality, have no positive effect on behavior and academic achievement, and emphasize the socioeconomic disparities they are intended to disguise.

12/19/2013 NEW ProCon.org Website! - Should the United States continue its use of drone strikes abroad? - Our 50th website explores the pros and cons in the debate over US drone strikes. Proponents say that drones have decimated terrorist networks abroad via precise strikes with minimum civilian casualties. They contend that drones are relatively inexpensive weapons, are used under proper government oversight, and that their use helps prevent "boots on the ground" combat and makes America safer. Opponents say that drone strikes create more terrorists than they kill. They contend that drone strikes kill large numbers of civilians, violate international law, lack sufficient congressional oversight, violate the sovereignty of other nations, and make the horrors of war appear as innocuous as a video game.

the US economy and Cuban citizens, and that the rest of the world is
against the US sanctions. Our 46th website explores the pros and

NEW ProCon.org Website! – Should churches (defined as churches, temples, mosques, synagogues, etc.) remain tax-exempt?
11/14/2011 – NEW ProCon.org Website! – Should churches (defined as churches, temples, mosques, synagogues, etc.) remain tax-exempt? – US churches have been exempt from paying income and property taxes since the country's founding. Debate continues over whether or not these tax benefits should be retained, especially during our tough economic times. Proponents argue that a tax exemption keeps the government out of church finances, and that churches deserve a tax break because they provide crucial social services. Opponents argue that giving churches special tax exemptions violates the separation of church and state, and that the government cannot afford what amounts to a subsidy worth billions of dollars every year. Our 44th website explores the pros and cons in the debate over church tax exemptions.

6/22/2011 – NEW ProCon.org Website! – Is the use of standardized tests improving education in America? – Standardized tests have been a part of American education since the mid-1800s. Their use skyrocketed after 2002's No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) mandated annual testing in all 50 states. Proponents say standardized tests are a fair and objective measure of student achievement, and that they ensure teachers and schools are accountable. Opponents say the tests are neither fair nor objective, and that their use narrows the curriculum and promotes "teaching to the test." ProCon.org's 42nd website explores the pros and cons in the debate over standardized tests.

NEW ProCon.org Website! – Should teachers get tenure?
1/13/2011 NEW ProCon.org Website! - Should teachers get tenure? - Teacher tenure is the increasingly controversial form of job protection that public school teachers in all states receive after 1-7 years on the job. Proponents of tenure argue that it protects teachers from being fired for personal or political reasons, and prevents the firing of experienced teachers to hire less expensive new teachers. Opponents argue that this job protection makes the removal of poorly performing teachers so difficult and costly that most schools end up retaining their bad teachers, and that tenure is no longer needed given current laws against job discrimination.
ProCon.org's 40th website explores the pros and cons of whether or not teachers should get tenure.

Some people argue that rising levels of human-produced greenhouse gases are warming the planet and causing the climate to change.  Others argue that reported greenhouse gas increases are too small to change the climate, and that 20th century warming has been the result of natural processes such as fluctuations in the sun’s heat and ocean currents.  ProCon.org's newest and 34th website explores the pros and cons in this debate.

"Pro-life” proponents generally believe abortion is immoral because personhood begins at conception, and therefore abortion kills innocent human beings.  "Pro-choice” advocates contend that a woman's right to control her pregnancy outweighs any right claimed for an embryo or fetus. ProCon.org's newest website explores the pros and cons in this debate.

Last updated on: 9/7/2017 9:23:06 AM PST
Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted in the United States?
Pro & Con Quotes
Readers' Comments (186)
PRO (yes)
Sharon Risher, MDiv, Reverend and Spokesperson for Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, in a July 28, 2017 article, "Everytown, Moms Demand Action Applaud Rep. Cylburn's Legislation to Close 'Charleston Loophole' That Allowed Charleston Shooter to Obtain Gun without a Complete Background Check," available at the Moms Demand Action website, stated:
"Two years ago my mother and cousins were gunned down by a white supremacist during a prayer service at their beloved Mother Emanuel Church. That hate-filled man never should have gotten his hands on a gun, and yet, through a loophole, he was able to arm himself and take the lives of nine beautiful church-goers, peacefully in prayer. If a full background check had been completed, my mother, cousins and six other loved ones would still be alive today…
Between 2010 and 2016, the Charleston loophole allowed nearly 23,000 gun sales to dangerous people who would have failed a criminal background check because the check could not be completed within three business days. After the three-day period has expired, federal law allows gun stores to sell a gun to a prospective buyer, even though the background check is not complete…
Background checks that have been completed have blocked more than two million sales to people who failed a background check, and have saved countless lives."
July 28, 2017 - Sharon Risher, MDiv
The American Medical Association, in a June 14, 2016 statement, "AMA Calls Gun Violence 'A Public Health Crisis;' Will Actively Lobby Congress to Lift Ban on CDC Gun Violence Research," available at ama-assn.org, stated:
"With approximately 30,000 men, women and children dying each year at the barrel of a gun in elementary schools, movie theaters, workplaces, houses of worship and on live television, the United States faces a public health crisis of gun violence... Our AMA 'recognizes that uncontrolled ownership and use of firearms, especially handguns, is a serious threat to the public's health inasmuch as the weapons are one of the main causes of intentional and unintentional injuries and deaths.' AMA policy supports legislation calling for a waiting period before purchasing any form of firearm in the U.S., and supports requiring background checks for all handgun purchasers.
Moreover, AMA policy supports stricter enforcement of present federal and state gun safety legislation, and the imposition of mandated penalties for crimes committed with the use of a firearm, including the illegal possession of a firearm."
June 14, 2016 - American Medical Association (AMA)
Zeid Ra'ad Zeid Al-Hussein, PhD, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, in a June 14, 2016 statement, "In Wake of Mass Shooting, UN Rights Chief Urges US to Consider Robust Gun Control," available at un.org, stated:
"It is hard to find a rational justification that explains the ease with which people can buy firearms, including assault rifles, in spite of prior criminal backgrounds, drug use, histories of domestic violence and mental illness, or direct contact with extremists – both domestic and foreign.
How many more mass killings of school-children, of co-workers, of African-American churchgoers -- how many more individual shootings of talented musicians like Christina Grimmie, or politicians like Gabrielle Giffords, will it take before the United States adopts robust gun regulation? Why should any civilian anywhere be able to acquire an assault rifle or other high-powered weapons designed to kill lots of people?
Irresponsible pro-gun propaganda suggests that firearms make society safer, when all evidence points to the contrary. The ready availability of guns leaves little space between murderous impulses and actions that result in death. The journey between hate-filled beliefs and violent hate crimes is accelerated. Society -- in particular its most vulnerable communities and minorities who are already facing widespread prejudice -- pay a high price for the failure to stand up to the lobbyists and take the necessary measures to protect people from gun violence.
Examples from many countries clearly show that a legal framework to control the acquisition and use of firearms has led to a dramatic reduction in violent crime."

"We can have common sense gun reforms that keep weapons out of the hands of criminals and the violently unstable while respecting responsible gun owners… The stakes are too high, the costs are too dear, and I am not and will not be afraid to keep fighting for common sense reforms, and along with you, achieve those on behalf of all who have been lost because of this senseless gun violence in this country."

"It's time we called this what it is: a national crisis...
So now, I'm doubling down, and I need your help. What we did in Maryland should be the first step of what we do as a nation. The NRA is already blaming the victims of yesterday's shooting for their own deaths, saying they too should have been armed. Let's put an end to this madness and finally stand up to them. Here are some steps we should be taking:
1. A national assault weapons ban.
2. Stricter background checks.
3. Efforts to reduce straw-buying, like fingerprint requirements."

The American Academy of Pediatrics, in a Jan. 2013 statement, "American Academy of Pediatrics Gun Violence Policy Recommendations," available at aap.org, stated:
"[T]he absence of guns from children’s homes and communities is the most reliable and effective measure to prevent firearm-related injuries in children and adolescents.
The AAP continues to support a number of specific measures to reduce the destructive effects of guns in the lives of children and adolescents through the implementation of the following recommendations:
Enact a strong, effective assault weapon ban;
Eliminate the gun show loophole and require mandatory background checks and waiting periods before all firearm purchases;
Ban on high capacity magazines;
Enact strong handgun regulations; and
Require safe firearm storage under federal law."

"The Brady Campaign supports a policy platform that addresses the problem of gun violence and is driven by the opportunity to save the most lives. Every death is a tragedy, whether in a mass shooting that horrifies our entire nation, or one of the 32 gun murders or 90 gun deaths in our communities and homes every day… Policies such as 'universal background checks' on all gun sales would keep guns out of the hands of felons, domestic abusers, the dangerously mentally ill and other illegal purchasers without impacting anyone else's Second Amendment right to own guns. Background checks are supported by the overwhelming majority of Americans, including gun owners, and they make us all safer."

John Traphagan, MAR, PhD, Professor of Religious Studies and Human Dimensions of Organizations at the University of Texas at Austin, in a May 20, 2015 article, "University of Texas Professor: Gun Control, National Security and Waco," available at newsok.com, stated:
"There is no need for a civilized society to tolerate the type of gun-related violence that Americans seem to accept as normal. The solution to gun-related crime isn't further arming the public. It involves enacting comprehensive gun control laws that prohibit many forms of gun ownership, significantly curtailing or eliminating access to and the ability to purchase guns, and implementing programs in which the government confiscates or purchases illegal guns already in circulation among the public.
For those firearms that are legal, ownership should be tied not only to background checks, but to extensive and mandatory training in the safe use and storage of weapons.
In an era of extreme concern about national security, Americans need to recognize that one of the greatest threats to national security is their own heavily armed population. Unfortunately, our proven inability to handle widespread gun ownership suggests strongly that the way to do this is to deeply restrict access to and ownership of most types of guns."

The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, on its "Issues" page (accessed Mar. 26, 2015), available at csgv.org, stated:
"Approximately 40% of gun sales are made without any background check—giving convicted felons, the dangerously mentally ill and others unchecked access to firearms. It’s long past time to require a background check on every gun sale in America…
Semiautomatic, military-style firearms are designed for one purpose: to kill people en masse, and quickly. They have no place on our streets, and are a threat to law enforcements officers and civilians alike…
Mental health screening for gun buyers in the United States is shallow, arbitrary and often unfair. A new standard must be developed that focuses on dangerousness—whether or not someone with mental illness presents a threat to self or others."

Gabrielle Giffords, MRP, Cofounder of Americans for Responsible Solutions and Former US Representative (D-AZ), in an Apr. 16, 2014 article, "Giffords: Fight Back against Political Cowardice," available at usatoday.com, stated:
"We need a comprehensive approach: a surge in mental health services, mental health 'first aid' programs to identify and intervene in problems before it's too late, and a background check system that will stop the most dangerous among us from buying guns, by getting records in the system and closing the Internet and gun-show loopholes…
We have done our homework, and the numbers don't lie: From Texas to New Hampshire and everywhere in between, we know that support for policies such as expanded background checks continue to be popular in both parties. Gun owners and non-gun owners alike agree on expanding background checks, making gun trafficking a serious crime with stiff penalties, making it illegal for all stalkers and all domestic abusers to buy guns, and expanding mental health resources so the mentally ill find it easier to receive treatment than to buy firearms."

Daniel Webster, ScD, MPH, Director of the Center for Gun Policy and Research at Johns Hopkins University, in a June 26, 2014 article, "Guns Kill People. And If We Had Universal Background Checks, They Wouldn't Kill So Many," available at newrepublic.com, stated:
"When criminals get guns, they get them from friends, family, or from an underground market source. Without universal background check requirements, there is little deterrent to selling guns to criminals or gun traffickers. State laws mandating universal background checks deter the diversion of guns to criminals. The most comprehensive screening and background check processes, where potential gun purchasers apply in person for permits to purchase handguns, are associated with lower homicide and suicide rates…
Better regulation of gun sales is only part of the solution. Policies should make it extremely risky for criminals to illegally carry and use guns, and we must expand efforts to diffuse conflicts involving high-risk individuals before they are settled with guns."

Monte Frank, JD, Attorney and Legal Advisor to Newton Action Alliance, in a Sep. 11, 2013 article, "We Need Lawmakers to Enact the People's Will on Gun Control," available at theguardian.com, stated:
"Let's ignore this vocal fringe group, some of whom openly advocate treason (in violation of article 3 section 3 of the constitution). Instead, Americans must come together to call for Congress to put politics aside and pass common-sense measures that the majority of Americans, including gun owners, support…
[W]e need to ban military-style weapons and 30-round magazines, so that when the next unstable individual slips through the cracks in our healthcare system, their ability to access an assault weapon won't be easier than buying a beer…
[A] federal anti-trafficking bill that includes real penalties for 'straw buyers' is imperative, since firearms are being transported through many states. A strong bill will dry up the 'iron pipeline', the supply of cheap and plentiful firearms into our cities…
Finally, universal background checks would help reduce the risk of a firearm ending up in the hands of a criminal, a person affected by mental illness, or a terrorist. Currently, under federal law, a person on our terrorist watchlist can buy the Bushmaster AR-15 – the weapon used at both the Sandy Hook elementary school and at the Aurora movie theater – in a private transaction, without any questions being asked."

Barack Obama, JD, US President, in the Feb. 12, 2013 State of the Union Address, available at whitehouse.gov, stated:
"It has been two months since Newtown. I know this is not the first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence. But this time is different. Overwhelming majorities of Americans -- Americans who believe in the Second Amendment -- have come together around common-sense reform, like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun. Senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals. Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets, because these police chiefs, they’re tired of seeing their guys and gals being outgunned.
Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress…. Because in the two months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays, graduations, anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun -- more than a thousand."

John E. Rosenthal, Cofounder of Stop Handgun Violence, in an Apr. 6, 2015 article, "Why I Support Gun Rights and Gun Laws," available at huffingtonpost.com, stated:
"I believe that, as a gun owner, I have a responsibility to my family and my community to store my gun safely, locked and unloaded. I also have a responsibility to advocate for responsible gun laws that help keep guns out of dangerous people's hands. That includes being willing to submit to a background check every time I purchase a firearm and expecting buyers to submit to a current background check if I sell them a gun. Furthermore, I believe that if I misuse my gun, for example if I violently threaten a family member or allow a child to gain access to a loaded and unlocked firearm, I should be held accountable for my actions…
Being concerned about the thirty-thousand-plus gun deaths each year in the United States does not make you anti-gun. And advocating for policies that make a dangerous product a little less dangerous just means you care about saving lives and countless grief from preventable firearm injuries and death. However, this message is so controversial that the gun industry, who thinks the Second Amendments trumps the First, wants to silence it."

Piers Morgan, journalist and TV personality, in the Mar. 28, 2014 episode of Piers Morgan Live, available on youtube.com, stated:
"I assumed that after 70 people were shot in a movie theater, and then, just a few months later, 20 first-graders were murdered with an assault rifle in an elementary school, the absurd gun laws in this country would change. But nothing has happened…
My point is simple: More guns doesn't mean less crime, as the NRA repeatedly tries to tell you. It means more gun violence, more death and more profits for the gun manufacturers. And to those who claim my gun control campaigning has been 'anti-American,' well, the reverse is true. I am so pro-American that I want more of you to stay alive. But I've made my point. I've given it a tremendous whack. Now it's down to you. It's your country; these are your gun laws. And the senseless slaughter will only end when enough Americans stand together and cry: 'Enough!'"

Michael Bloomberg, MBA, former New York City Mayor and Cofounder of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, in a Jan. 14, 2013 opening address at Johns Hopkins University Summit on Reducing Gun Violence in America, available at nyc.gov, stated:
"First and most urgently, we need the President and Congress together to require background checks for all gun sales – including private sales at gun shows and online. These private sales now account for more than 40 percent of all gun sales nationally – which means that in 2012 alone, there were more than six million gun sales that happened with no background checks…
Second, Congress should make gun trafficking a Federal crime. In New York City, 85 percent of the weapons that we recover from crime scenes come from out-of-state sources – but Federal laws designed to curb illegal sales across borders are incredibly weak. Criminals who traffic get a slap on the wrist…
The third legislative measure that the White House should support is limiting the availability of military-style weapons and high-capacity magazines with more than ten rounds. These guns and equipment are not designed for sport or home defense. They are designed to kill large numbers of people quickly. That’s the only purpose they have."

The National Rifle Association's official response was 'If that teacher had been armed…' It's crazy. I'll give Britain its dues, when they had the Dunblane massacre in Scotland, within 24 hours the gun laws were changed so you could not have a handgun."

John Walsh, Creator and Former Host of America's Most Wanted, in a July 14, 2014 interview, "10 Things John Walsh Said about Gun Control, the NRA, and More," available at auburnpub.com, stated:
"I've seen what guns do in America. I'm gun owner. I know about guns and I have guns, and I believe we need reasonable gun control. Many countries have all kinds of safeguards, and none have the violence we have—there were 11 murders in Chicago last weekend. I talked to the president and vice president about reasonable background checks—that’s all I'm talking about. We're the richest country on the planet and we have the most violence. All the capitals of Western Europe combined don't have as many homicides as Chicago does…
We've got to start somewhere, with reasonable gun control. We need to have what this country doesn't have: A reasonable mental health system so when you go for a gun, they can see if you're under psychiatric care — all the things you need to do in Canada or New Zealand or Australia or Japan. The things I'm proposing to the NRA are so simple and so much-needed because we're a country of 350 million with about 450 million guns. There's a way to start, and that's some reasonable gun registration and background checks. So when people get upset about that — I'm a gun owner; no one's gonna take my shotguns away or my 9 millimeters away. I'm probably the only guy in America who needs guns, I get so many death threats from nutcases."

Al Sharpton, Baptist Minister and civil rights activist, in an Oct. 27, 2011 article, "How to End Gun Violence? Get Guns off of the Street," available at huffingtonpost.com, stated:
"Gun supporters and advocates always champion the 2nd Amendment and our right to bear arms. But this right doesn't mean that everyone should possess a weapon. It doesn't mean guns should be so readily accessible to the least stable among us. And it doesn't mean that we don't need stricter gun laws to keep them out of the hands of criminals and those with a complete disregard for human life. Perhaps the fierce gun proponents need to take a walk in our neighborhoods, where young children have to dodge bullets just to get an education, or where mothers and fathers spend sleepless nights figuring out ways to keep their families safe...
[W]e cannot continue to bury our precious ones. Life is indeed short, but let's not make it shorter by killing one another needlessly. Get guns out of the community and stop them from ever finding their way back in. Together, we can save ourselves -- and the next generation."

"We recognize that the individual right to bear arms is an important part of the American tradition, and we will preserve Americans’ Second Amendment right to own and use firearms. We believe that the right to own firearms is subject to reasonable regulation. We understand the terrible consequences of gun violence; it serves as a reminder that life is fragile, and our time here is limited and precious. We believe in an honest, open national conversation about firearms. We can focus on effective enforcement of existing laws, especially strengthening our background check system, and we can work together to enact commonsense improvements–like reinstating the assault weapons ban and closing the gun show loophole–so that guns do not fall into the hands of those irresponsible, law-breaking few."

The National Rifle Association (NRA) in a June 29, 2017 article, "No. Gun Control Is NOT a Winning Issue," available at medium.com, stated:
"Voters know that gun safety does not mean whittling away at their Right to Keep and Bear Arms. It doesn't mean restricting where or how a law-abiding citizen can exercise a constitutionally protected right. And, it certainly doesn't mean forcing hunters or target shooters to go to a Federally Licensed Firearm dealer for a background check before they can borrow each other's guns for an afternoon.
Real gun safety is the fact that over the last 20 years, the annual number of gun-related accidental deaths has decreased by more than half. Or the fact that guns are only involved in 0.4% of accidental deaths among the U.S. population. Real gun safety is also found in the training programs that the NRA offers each year by one of our more than 125,000 NRA Certified Instructors and Range Safety Officers.
The gun control agenda has one goal, and it has nothing to do with keeping people safe. Instead, it has everything to do with decreasing the number of guns in America and making them more difficult to legally purchase. That doesn't make Americans safer?—it simply makes them unarmed and vulnerable."
[Editor's Note: On Oct. 5 the NRA released a joint statement from CEO and Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre and Chief Lobbyist for the NRA-ILA Chris Cox that included a reaffirmation of the organization's stance against gun control, and the following: "The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations." The statement was made in response to the shooting in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, 2017 in which the shooter used bump stocks to make semi-automatic guns function like automatic guns.]

"I am in the camp that if you outlaw guns only the criminals are going to have guns. I supported permitting the concealed carry of handguns in New Mexico. I believe there is a lot less violence in the parking lot, as they say, because the potential perpetrator of a theft or an assault is thinking twice because someone might be carrying a gun. Restrictions on gun ownership will only encourage outlaws to have heavy ammunition and high calibre weapons."

"In this particular case [the Emanuel AME church shooting in Charleston, SC], the FBI made a mistake. The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job. Because that person [Dylann Roof], should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check. The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens…
I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is. It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away. You're going away for a long, long while."

More gun laws won't prevent evil people from doing evil things. Human nature cannot be legislated away. No amount of laws can ever eliminate evil acts committed by evil men. But gun control laws like those in South Carolina certainly can eliminate the ability of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves from those who intend to do evil. And that’s a tragedy."

"I support people having a gun in public full stop, not just in your home. We don't have the right to bear arms because of burglars; we have the right to bear arms to resist the supreme power of a corrupt and abusive government. It's not about duck hunting; it's about the ability of the individual. It's the same reason we have freedom of speech. It's well known that the greatest defence against an intruder is the sound of a gun hammer being pulled back. All these gun shootings that have gone down in America since 1950, only one or maybe two have happened in non-gun-free zones. Take mass shootings. They've only happened in places that don't allow guns. These people are sick in the head and are going to kill innocent people. They are looking to slaughter defenceless human beings. They do not want confrontation. In all of our schools it is illegal to have guns on campus, so again and again these guys go and shoot up these… schools because they know there are no guns there. They are monsters killing six-year-olds…
Banning guns is like banning forks in an attempt to stop making people fat. Taking away guns, taking away drugs, the booze, it won't rid the world of criminality."

"What I think is two things, number one, that restricting the right to keep and bear arms is unconstitutional.
The Second Amendment is an integral part of the Bill of Rights. And what it means is, politicians cannot come and strip the guns from law-abiding Americans. But, number two, it's misguided policy. If you look at the jurisdictions with the strictest gun control laws, almost without exception, they have the highest crime rates and the highest murder rates.
If you look at the jurisdictions that most vigorously protect our right to keep and bear arms, almost without exception, they have the lowest crime rates and the lowest murder rates. Gun control policies don't work. And they're contrary to the Constitution."

"I have a lot of guns. I’m a big hunter. I've been shooting guns since I was a kid. I'm very familiar with how these weapons operate, with how semiautomatics operate. I think you’re getting to the point where you're making changes in law that won't make a difference [such as large clip bans] and you're compromising people's Second Amendment rights.
There are legitimate reasons for citizens to own these weapons ["assault weapons"]. Whether it's for hunting. People do use these for hunting. Whether it's for target shooting or self-defense. There are legitimate reasons for people owning these guns.
We've got 310 million guns in this country. You really think we're going to stop these guns? We still had Columbine during that time [of the the assault weapons ban]. The point I'm saying is why did the kid do that? What's wrong with our culture, or what's wrong with our system, where a person who is clearly mentally ill, missed all the checks to get him the help he needed to prevent that from happening."

"Guns require a finger to pull the trigger. The sad young man who did that in Newtown was clearly haunted by demons and no gun law could have saved the children in Sandy Hook Elementary from his terror…
In fact, the piling on by the political left, and their cohorts in the media, to use the massacre of little children to advance a pre-existing political agenda that would not have saved those children, disgusts me, personally.

We can't forget that the first three victims were stabbed to death. Now that's not something that the national news media wants to talk about. A number of victims were hit by a car, gun control obviously wouldn't have prevented that behavior either. They have very strict mental health rules with regards to firearm ownership in California. There are things that can and should be done, the National Rifle Association is interested in addressing these underlying problems. We have underlying problems with a lack of school security, a lack of armed security in our schools. We have a problem with a lack of prosecution coming out of [Attorney General] Eric Holder and Barack Obama's administration, and we have a problem, no question, with regards to these gun control laws that leave people defenseless, and we have a problem with a mental health system that's completely bankrupt…
[T]he blame needs to be placed on the politicians in California who time and time again their answer to these issues are more and more gun control laws. They have passed every gun control law imaginable and it hasn't done a… thing, and that's a tragedy in and of itself."

"Let's look at the crimes committed by Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook Elementary School killer. First, he killed his mother. Then he stole his mother’s guns… I think it is a safe bet that Lanza broke some laws transporting loaded firearms. It is almost certainly against the law to enter a school with a loaded firearm… In addition to killing 26 people, Lanza committed an undisclosed number of attempt [sic] murders, at least one burglary when he entered the school after shooting off the lock, and probably a plethora of other crimes, including but not limited to, shooting into an inhabited building, shooting within city limits and negligent firearms use. If we tighten our gun control laws, if we enact more and 'tougher' gun control laws, won't that just be more, tighter and tougher laws that sociopaths can ignore? We don't need more and/or tighter gun control."

"In the wake of tragedies such as Newtown, gun control advocates keep pushing for more restrictions. But the proposed regulations have nothing to do with the tragedies…
Even worse for gun control advocates, people are realizing that regulations — such as gun-free zones — tend to encourage attacks by disarming law-abiding citizens instead of criminals.
Hopefully, cities such as Washington, Los Angeles and New York will change their rules as more poor blacks and women recognize the benefits of gun ownership. At present, only rich, well-connected people can get concealed carry permits in those places. The poor have every bit as much right to defend themselves."

"[M]ost criminals obtain guns from theft, the black market, or 'straw purchasers'—people who can pass a background check and who buy guns for criminals. Furthermore, none of the high-profile crimes that they cite involved guns bought without a background check…
Americans own well over 100 million 'large' magazines and the nation's murder rate is nearly at an all-time low…
'Assault weapon' is the term that gun control supporters use to malign general-purpose rifles like the AR-15. Americans now own five million AR-15s, the number is growing by several hundred thousand annually, and the nation’s murder rate is down by more than half since 1991…
NRA opposes requiring guns to be made with electronic equipment that would allow the guns to be deactivated remotely, or with other features that gun owners do not want…
Gun control supporters want markings on bullets and cartridge cases fired from new handguns to be entered into a database. NRA opposes it, because enforcing it would require gun registration…
NRA opposes legislation to prohibit the possession of firearms by people on the watchlist, because the FBI will not say who is on the list or why, and the legislation would violate the 5th Amendment by preventing a watchlisted person from challenging the FBI in a fair and open hearing in court.

Of course our Constitution. So it was enshrined and they knew that if the Second Amendment goes, the rest of the Constitution is not far behind. They are trying though. They, you know who they are. Look, if you control oil, you control an economy. If you control money, you control commerce. But, if you control arms, you control people. And that is what they're trying…
And I love our police. I do. But they can't be everywhere, you know, so maybe our kids can be defended against criminals on the spot if more mama grizzlies carried. And Obama administration wants you ID'd for that? Well, then, just go ahead and carry a sign too. A sign that says, 'Yeah, I carry a gun, because a cop is too heavy.'
Aren't they something though? Aren't they something? Blaming that chunk of steel, you know, the weapon itself for the crime committed. They even blame sporting goods stores that sell arms, accusing them of being an accomplice. MmmHmm. Gun stores are an accomplice to crime. And that fork made me fat."
Apr. 27, 2014 - Sarah Palin
Aaron Zelman, the late founder and Executive Director of Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership, in a 2009 interview, titled "No Compromise against Gun Control: Aaron Zelman Interviewed," available at www.jpfo.org, stated:
"Our main goal is to destroy gun control. We are an organization that believes we have the moral authority to point out to the rest of the world the evils that have come from gun control and how humanity has suffered because of gun-control schemes…
I think there are numerous threats, but one is that the American public really doesn't understand a need for an armed citizenry. Our country became independent because citizens were armed. This is why an organized, state-controlled militia received attention in the U.S. Constitution. So we have a lot of work to do. We have to reach out to people and help them understand why citizens must be armed, and what's happened to citizens throughout the world and throughout history when they couldn't defend themselves against a government gone bad."
2009 - Aaron Zelman
Rick Santorum, MBA, JD, Former US Senator and Representative (R-PA), in an Apr. 27, 2014 interview, "Face the Nation Transcripts April 27 2014: Netanyahu, Blinken, McCaskill, Corker," available at cbsnews.com, stated:
"I think a well-armed family is a safe family; a well-armed America is a safer America. I think if you look at anything, from all of these attacks that have taken place, is if people actually had had weapons there those attacks would have been thwarted and people's lives would have been saved.
In fact, there are millions of lives that are saved in America every year, millions of instances where gun owners have prevented crimes and stopped things from happening because of having guns at the scene…
You know, everybody romanticizes the O.K. Corral and all the horrible things that happened, but gun crimes were not very prevalent back then. Why? Because people carried guns. And, you know, the folks who use guns in the commission of crimes are cowards. And if you look at going to theatres, they went to a theatre in Aurora, Colorado, that they knew, you know, you could go there and no one else was going to be there with a gun.
If we are a country where the criminal doesn't know whether someone has a gun or not, they're going to think twice about opening fire or not because they won't be able to accomplish what they want. It's a wrong-headed approach that somehow or another, if we take guns away from people, law-abiding people who want to protect themselves, that the world's going to be safer. In fact, just the opposite is the case."
Apr. 27, 2014 - Rick Santorum, MBA, JD
Ted Nugent, musician, hunter, and author, in an interview, available in the Feb. 12, 2013 article, "Ted Nugent Sings Praises of Gun Ownership," available at cnn.com, stated:
"It's not the weapons. The weapons have nothing to do with it. Again, these weapons are in every pickup truck in Texas. People have to get past the hardware.
I would never turn against this wonderful tool that brings me self-defense capabilities and brings me great joy in competition and marksmanship training.
In all these mass shootings, it's not a matter of bullets or firepower. A quail gun in the wrong hands is as deadly as this gun [points to an AR rifle]. People have got to come to that reality.
There is no gun violence. There is criminal violence. And they use an assortment of tools. The gun owners of America are causing no problem. Leave us alone. Let's go after the mentally deranged who are doing all these vicious crimes. Let's go after the recidivistic maggots that judges and prosecutors unleash into our neighborhoods."
Feb. 12, 2013 - Ted Nugent
The Republican National Committee, in the "2012 We Believe in America Republican Platform," available at gop.com, stated:
"We uphold the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, a right which antedated the Constitution and was solemnly confirmed by the Second Amendment. We acknowledge, support, and defend the law-abiding citizen's God-given right of self-defense… Gun ownership is responsible citizenship, enabling Americans to defend their homes and communities. We condemn frivolous lawsuits against gun manufacturer and oppose federal licensing or registration of law-abiding gun owners. We oppose legislation that is intended to restrict our Second Amendment rights by limiting the capacity of clips or magazines or otherwise restoring the ill-considered Clinton gun ban."
2012 - Republican National Committee
The Libertarian Party, in the "Libertarian Party 2014 Platform" adopted in June 2014, available at lp.org, stated:
"We affirm the individual right recognized by the Second Amendment to keep and bear arms, and oppose the prosecution of individuals for exercising their rights of self-defense. Private property owners should be free to establish their own conditions regarding the presence of personal defense weapons on their own property. We oppose all laws at any level of government restricting, registering, or monitoring the ownership, manufacture, or transfer of firearms or ammunition."
June 2014 - Libertarian Party
The Constitution Party, in the "Gun Control" section of the "Abridged 2012-2016 National Platform," available at the Constitution Party website, stated:
"The right to bear arms is inherent in the right of self defense, defense of the family, and defense against tyranny, conferred on the individual and the community by our Creator to safeguard life, liberty, and property, as well as to help preserve the independence of the nation.
The right to keep and bear arms is guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the Constitution; it may not properly be infringed upon or denied.
The Constitution Party upholds the right of the citizen to keep and bear arms. We oppose attempts to prohibit ownership of guns by law-abiding citizens, and stand against all laws which would require the registration of guns or ammunition.
We emphasize that when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have them. In such circumstances, the peaceful citizen's protection against the criminal would be seriously jeopardized.
We call for the repeal of all federal firearms legislation, beginning with Federal Firearms Act of 1968.
We call for the rescinding of all executive orders, the prohibition of any future executive orders, and the prohibition of treaty ratification which would in any way limit the right to keep and bear arms."
2012 - Constitution Party

"There are a large number of different types of "gun control" some are common sense, and others are a very bad idea for a number of reasons.If someone is mentally ill - NO GUNIf someone has been convicted of a violent felony - NO GUNChild Safety Locks - Great IdeaClosing the gun show loophole - Great IdeaRequire proper and safe gun storage - Great IdeaThe rest gets sketchy. I for one, do not want the government to have a list of gun owners. That just makes it too easy for a future government to round up our guns.I do not support assault weapons bans or high capacity magazine bans.I support open and concealed carry.By the way, I am not a conservative or a Republican"

"I do agree with you, however there are many people who have a mental illness and feel like they shouldn't be withheld that right to own a weapon. That is classifying people, and from what everyone has seen, others don't like that. Perhaps instead of restricting things from all people it grows simpler, no guns in a hospital, jail, government house, or mental hospital. That way people that aren't in mental hospitals can use their gun. Also, a background check should be put down for when you're buying a gun (I don't know if they already do this, I do not own a gun) that way if you've ever been In a mental hospital or in jail for a MAJOR act, you are denied one for public safety and safety of yourself."

"This is for number 15. An AR-15 is not a military rifle. It is also not called the M16 by the Air Force. The gun that person was thinking of was the M4, which is still a different gun than the M16. Almost all of the information for that example is entirely false. Those guns will also not "shred your venison" because the three guns I mentioned fire the 5.56 NATO (2.23) round. That is actually a low caliber round compared to a lot of hunting rifles."

"@Ryan Dukes I also agree with fully. A 223 will put a much smaller hole in a deer then your common deer rifles. Such as the common 3030 or 30.6 I have used all three of the calibers to hunt and the 223 did the least amount of damage to the buck. With the 3030 you will have to track a deer about 50 yds with a good shot. With the 223 I had to track it multiple hundreds of yards. It is not the gun that kills people. People kill people."

"Listen to this song (Money Talks by AC/DC) while you read this post: In the 2016 election, the NRA spent $11,438,118 to support Donald Trump, and another $19,756,346 to oppose Hillary Clinton. That's over $31 million spent on one presidential race.For the government to pass stricter gun control laws, we need more heroes like businessman Mr. Hoffman, who yesterday told the New York Times that he "will not write another check" for candidates and political groups that don't support a ban on assault weapons. The Florida-based former ambassador to Portugal has donated millions to GOP candidates and political groups over the years, reported the paper.If everyone told Republican candidates that they won't vote for them, or donate any money, unless they make a public statement guaranteeing that they will support stricter gun control laws, changes will begin to happen."

"When a kid hits another kid with a stick, you take away the stick. When a kid accidentally pokes their eye with a stick, you take away the stick. And when you have a nurse's office full of kids who are injured because of sticks, you clear sticks from the schoolyard and put in a rule that states nobody can play with sticks. Checkmate."

"(insert any & all objects that hurt people)....your argument is invalid.If going by your comment, Europe should be have banned cars since those terrorist used cars to hurt/kill as many as possible, during the day, at a shop......yet no mention of getting rid of cars for the protection of others.People have to accept this important fact: Some people don't care and break rules anyway. Making new laws won't make them behave, if they are breaking rules Anyway."

"I agree with you compleetly, but even if it doesn't reduce the criminal rate and/or people using them with bad intintions the amount people that will still use them for harm, will most likely, not decrease, because you say that people should be able to use them may have an affect on the rate of people missusing them."

"I'm not saying that guns should be banned, but that there should be more gun control to prevent many deaths and unfortunate events from happening. Many deaths are caused by gun violence. The United States has more citizens that own guns more than any other country, but yet the United States is also the country that has the most deaths caused by firearm. Guns are very dangerous and having more access to a gun increases the risk of violence. There should be more strict gun laws, especially when it comes to children because a lot of kids are finding their parents or guardians firearms and accidentally hurting themselves. Also, if there were more gun control the amount of mass shootings would go down. The amount of mass shootings that have been going on, especially in schools. it would make sense for the government to put more rules and regulations on gun control to prevent these events from happening. Those who have guns should have rules that state what that gun can be used for. So that way those who have guns can only use them for certain reasons and not taken out into the public unless it is in those rules, preventing any harm happening."

"Students that are trying to learn and explore their dreams and visions in life has to worry about the student next to them may open fire, a student came walk into a school and open fire. My heart and condolences goes out to the families who have lost a child to gun violence . Whether it is in a school or public place. I would like to suggest the following ways to hinder gun violence in the schools, by doing the following: metal detectors in each school, each backpack will be searched upon entering the class, no coats or jackets past the waist, daily volunteers whom must past background checks to assist 2-3 hours of their day monitoring the campus, all schools aren't fortunate enough to have police of staff daily. Just think about it, if a student can't get into a school through the metal detectors , another student can let them inside from another entrance. That's another reason why we need cameras , school monitor volunteers, police officers inside the schools, metal detectors, random locker and backpack and purse search as well as teachers taking control of their classrooms by checking each bag, coat, jacket before the student can enter the class. We have to create a safe environment for children."

"Guns don't kill people, people with guns kill people. This is a true fact, and I believe in it. A gun laying there is no danger whatsoever, but if someone picked it up and shot it, that is dangerous. "I believe that many people have guns, and follow the laws of the nation, but criminals will not. If we make more laws about gun control, more background checks will be done, and anyone with evidence of criminality, or being unwillingly taken into a mental institute, will be undergone with more in-depth checks. If gun control laws are put into order, the United States could be in less danger, even if criminals don't follow the laws."

"We have more than sufficient gun control laws in the United States. The problem is enforcement. Many of the perpetrators in these cases never made it into the data-base. As I have said. Why should I give up my guns because the FBI and the local police and the board of education screwed up in Parkland Florida."

"I still feel that gun control is necessary in a country like the US. The problem is what should the question be? What kind of culture or society do you envision? Do you see your neighbors as someone you need to protect yourself from? Do you feel vulnerable to possible violence? If that is the case, then the question should be why and how to improve the overall health of the society. Gun control is only one part of the solution. Ther are much deeper questions that need to be asked."

"With reference to the article, Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted? (https://gun-control.procon.org), I agree that there should be more gun control laws enacted in America. Already, America has seen too many times when guns have been used for the wrong purposes (school shootings, concert shootings etc). In 2013, the most recent year for which government statistics are available, less than 2 percent of more than 33,000 gun deaths in the country were due to mass shootings. Most of these deaths would not have happened, if the guns were not entrusted to people with harmful intent.We have experienced school shootings in this country, and have lost too many innocent lives for nothing. Guns should only be used by police, or law enforcement agencies that are trying to protect the people. They should not be sold to everyone, like they are now. I believe that if we implement stricter gun laws then we will see a decrease in mass shootings and high death tolls."

"I agree almost completely with John Brown (top-ish comment). I'll also add that a huge benefit to decreasing gun deaths is BACKGROUND CHECKS. Can't stress that enough. I believe background checks cover the first few items John lists and if they were more extensive we would see less people who shouldn't have guns, having guns. I don't believe this is an "invasion of privacy" simply because these background checks wouldn't check any further than is relevant to owning a firearm. For example: mental illness, prior crimes, whether or not you have owned a gun/had gun training, etc. This info is a tiny price to pay for national safety.Other than that, I honestly have little problem with guns (I actually want a gun btw), it's just the way people are looking at the problem. It isn't ban all guns or keep all guns. It needs to meet in the middle with reasonable restrictions and rules. It would also be a huge help to improve mental health care.Hope this helped you understand (or better understand) this opinion on the issue. PS. Also not a conservative/republican. :)"

"The idea that anyone (including those that are mentally ill!) should have unhindered access to firearms is just plain STUPID! While I understand that RATIONAL gun ownership (a firearm for home or personal defense, or for hunting purposes), is acceptable and protected, the idea that ANY American needs endless quantities of ASSAULT WEAPONS to shoot up cities (e.g. Las Vegas), or endless numbers of schools is INSANE! Until the "pro-2nd Amendment zealots" are on the RECEIVING END of the massacres that mentally ill people have given this country, with their UNHINDERED ACCESS TO FIREARMS, only then will we get rational control of firearms. Until THAT comes, we are ALL TARGETS!"

"it is not unhindered access. there are back round checks for guns. but there is always the black market to get more guns. it is not the hardest thing to be able to just get a gun illegally. but if everyone has guns. those bad people would then not want to rob a house cause they have a gun that they can use to shoot you. so you would not rob it. and also I think teachers should have guns and have a note at the entrance that there is X amount of teachers with guns at this school. the principle will know of course who they are."

"There should be laws that restrict who gets to have a gun and what exactly they should use it for as a gun owner. This way at least rates of murders and accidental death can drop down. It is now needed because society now has changed the reputation on guns. So, if we put restrictions on guns only certain people can get their hands-on guns for any personal reasons. But we should put restrictions on these gun owners as well. Like usually to obtain a gun it should always be the same as it is today. With laws added it would limit certain things that today's society is dealing with. If a criminal wants to get their hands on this weapon they will do everything in their power to do so. With laws there, limits to do this will be lower and risker. They probably would obtain a less dangerous weapon and that will probably be used instead. We can argue about Mexico having stricter laws but mass shooting happen every single day but their government is not strongly set up like ours so there's is corrupt so how do we compare our self with them, everyday hundreds of people die but obviously cartels are the ones in charged of those murders, not regular civilians that live a non-narcotic life."

"The most effective way to reduce gun violence while minimizing infringement of individual rights is through use of a Gun Violence Restraining Order (GVRO). Federal law already considers it a crime for those accused of or convicted of domestic abuse to possess a firearm. Based on recent mass shootings, it would be reasonable to allow state or local governments to issue restraining orders like the ones issued for individuals suspected of or convicted of domestic abuse. California has had a law like this since 2016.For a GVRO to be issued, someone close to the individual would need to present proof that there is reason to be concerned about the individual's. This could be someone who lives with the individual, is closely related or even works with or around the individual daily. The close friend or family would have to provide the court with evidence that the individual is a danger to himself or others. (Examples: screen shots of online threats or sworn testimony from witnesses). The individuals would have a chance to present their case to the court. The restraining order would not be permanent. But, could be renewed if the individual was still presenting worrisome behavior."

"There are many gun control laws already that have helped reduced the crime rates tremendously but i do feel like there should be more. I believe that many people have guns, and follow the laws of the nation, but criminals will not. If we make more specific laws about gun control and did more background checks on people and made sure that anyone with evidence of criminality, or being unwillingly taken into a mental institution, that they will not be allowed to have any types of guns/ firearm or will be checked more in depth will change so much. If gun control laws are put into order and guns are watched more carefully so no illegal guns gets around, the United States could be in less danger, even if criminals don't follow the laws."

"I would like to add a point of thought to this. If an owner commands a "dog" to attack someone, should the "dog" be blamed for it? Many people have "pets" and take care of them well, and some people can use their "pets" to protect themselves, but some people misuse the "pet." I say this because if a weapon is taken care of well(put in a safe or has a lock on the trigger),or if it is cautiously used in only emergencies, it is fine. It is the owners choice of what to do with their property. But if an owner is misusing their weapons and property, it is that owners fault, so why should we take away everyone's guns if only a fraction of the people are misusing them? Also, if we do end up removing guns, people could either find ways to illegally own them or find weapons that may not be equally effective but are still dangerous(crossbows, throwing knives, tasers, etc)."

I'm just commenting to say this as someone who has experienced this: when you are suicidal, you WILL find a way to kill yourself, guns or not. CO poisoning, hanging, jumping, slitting, suicide bags, electrocution, etc. Gun laws will reduce the rates of suicide via firearm, but won't decrease the amount of suicides."

"Yes, I think gun laws should be stricter. There has been a large outbreak of gun violence all across the United States. If we don't stop gun violence who will? We should put a stop to gun violence, we need to put a stop to gun violence because if we don't the next lives to be taken from this earth could be ours. So I say lets take a stand and if we don't gun violence will escalate and we might not live long enough to regret it. So thank you for hearing me out; so that I might change a mind that before was unchangeable."

When they are profiting from tragedy, I think we need to to look deeper into that, report the event but don't over report, it give sick people the idea that they will get there names remembered for their sick act. The Umpqua Community College was a good example of how to handle the incident. The sherif never spoke the name of the killer."

"I am for a real solution to the problem of gun violence in the USA. Is it realistic to expect gun control to prevent or reduce these school massacres? Here is a fact that neither side wants to point out:Finland - Has tight gun registration requirements, universal background checks and an socially advanced society. Since 2000 there has been two school massacres in Finland. Jokela in 2007 and Kauhajoki in 2008. 18 deaths (or 20 including the perpetrators who committed suicide). Extrapolate that to the USA population (Finland has only 5.4 million people) and you have 120 school shootings and 1100 deaths... This number dwarfs the figures for the USA during the same period.For the record both perpetrators used 22 caliber handguns, not assault rifles or a high power handguns.For "gun control" to prevent this type of tragedy ALL GUNS WOULD HAVE TO BE BANNED which is impossible to accomplish in the USA. Anything short of that is a play on the emotions of the moment for political gain."

"If I could have total say in this situation, citizens would have to go through a more in depth process to obtain the right to own and possess a gun. Those with severe mental disorders and on medications that prohibit good judgment would not be allowed to own a gun. Research has shown that most of those who illegally shoot others have a severe mental disorder that blocks sound judgment. Furthermore, only certain types of guns should be allowed to be possessed by individuals. Machine guns and such should not be allowed. Only the military may have access to certain lethal weapons for protecting our country."

"Stricter gun laws will lower the crime rate. With firmer gun laws the crime rate would be lower. Take Canada for example, there is no legal right to possess arm. Canada process of purchasing a gun is stricter than the U.S. They have their own restriction on gun laws whereas most semi-automatic assault weapons are banned causing them to have a low gun statistic. "In 2009, there were 0.5 deaths per 100,000 from gun homicide - only 173 people"."

"I am in favor of enacting more gun laws in the United States. One common ground between people who want more gun laws and people that don't is that we all do not want to see mass-shootings and killings that could have otherwise been stopped. By enacting better background checks and more mental health screenings it limits the people that will be able to walk into stores and buy guns. For example, you do not want anyone that is mentally ill buying a gun. Screenings and checks are important, but there will always be loopholes in the system (which is private party gun sales). These gun sales are undocumented and many happen at gun shows. Even though there is a loophole in the process of buying guns I believe that there should be bans on high-capacity magazines. Most of all the mass shootings in recent history were done with high-capacity magazines some of which can hold up to 100 or more rounds. Banning the sale of high-capacity magazines will eliminate the possibly of people like Nikolas Cruz to open fire in such a manner and it will limit the used of guns that use high-capacity magazines like the AR-15 rifle."

"Guns should be illegal because if you own a gun and happened to have any suicidal thoughts you could easily just go ahead and kill yourself. Then the person that gave you the gun would most likely be put in jail not the person animal or thing that put (or gave) those suicidal thoughts inside of your skull that now has a hole in it. A bullet sized hole."

"Looking at the amount of gun related deaths i think there should be more gun control laws to make it harder for the mentally ill and people with a criminal history to attain them. Good citizens should have a right to defend themselves and the ones they care about from the evil in this world. Enforcing too much gun control could make it easier for criminals to prey on innocents. As far as the types of guns that should be banned I do agree with burst-fire or fully automatic weapons being banned because of their lethality, but see no reason to ban semi-automatic weapons such as an AR-15 just because they resemble military weapons.When it comes down to the real issue is the mental health of our nation. We need to make sure that we have responsible gun-owners that know how to handle these weapons. We need to look at the criminal mind, and see why there is so much violence in our country right now."

"I come from Norway, one of the safest countries in the world. In Norway gun violence is almost unheard off. It just doesn't happen. Because of our strict gun control laws everybody who want to own a gun has to get a background check, and also basic training where the applicant gets closely supervised over this person is responsible enough to own a gun. Owning a gun shouldn't be a right. It is a privilege one has to earn."

"As a gun owner,I DO NOT want to take ALL of anyone's guns away, nor do I want there to be an outlaw or ban of ALL guns. I would like to see that all military style weaponry and assault rifles (AR15, AK-47, and Mc-10 etc.) be exclusively for our military professionals, and our law enforcement officers, and anyone else needing, "A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." I am aware of some of the United States Navy weapons training, for instance in boot camp, there's a week long training on just pistols and shot-guns, then there is over a month of M4 training, as well as the 3 weeks more for the .50 caliber and .240, and this is in a span of under 3 years active duty The sailor has already had roughly 2.5 months. If civilians want to have such an arsenal, I feel that the training should parallel the military's or better. Also the mental stability of a private citizen should be taken in to consideration. I learned recently that to be in corrections or an officer of the law there's mental health tests, and psychological testing that needs to be assessed. Couldn't hurt to incorporate?"

This method could be used to enforce ammunition limits and make it easier to crack down on lawbreakers by creating more clear situations of ether they have codes and are legal or they don't and need to be confiscated. Please let me know what your thoughts on this idea.Jacob B. age 16 Sophomore"

"Danielle, thank you for giving me feedback, I understand that home production is an option to those trying to evade the law, but unless they had a registry of unused bullet codes I think it would be near impossible to produce valid codes that would hold up under a police scanner, the secondary benefit to tracking bullets is that you would be able to tell if they offender is using real bullets, and hopefully they could be apprehended before anything escalates due to it being impossible to hide the fact that they are using home made bullets, the other thing that could be implemented is a comunity based alert system to let police know if someone is producing ileagle bullets. Thank you for listening to my thoughtsJacob B"

"when you use things such as background checks including name, addresses, and mental health anyone now has access to all of that and if they were to use it they nowhave your address and your name. Earlier this year someone had hacked and stole credit card numbers from target and home depot. How long exactly would it take someone with that skill to get into those background checks. granted you should use some sort of it to check mental health, but you should not be able to find that persons address, name, or whatever else that may be on it. I personaly think that checking mental health and criminal history should be checked, but not all of thier personal information"

"A lot of people that believe we need more gun control need to realize that we already DO have universal background checks. There is also no such thing as a "gun show loophole". People on the far left hate cops, and believe cops are running around in the streets killing black people for no reason, yet they also want to remove weapons from the hands of our citizens, leaving the police holding all of the power. Makes sense!"

"Laws are not passed to take away anyone's rights. Gun control laws must be enacted to save the lives of people who gather peacefully. For example, the Parkland, Florida, shooting 17 students/staff died. By having stronger gun control laws, the shooter may have never been able to obtain an assault weapon used to murder high school students. There have been over 39 mass shootings in the year of 2018(Gun). Gun laws need to be enacted for public safety due to a large number of mass shootings recorded over the past years. Semiautomatic weapons are used for times of war not for personal use. Semiautomatic weapons have been used in mass shootings to take the lives of many people. According to criminologist Grant Duwe, the numbers of deadly shootings have risen in the past few years (Washington Post 2018). Mass shootings will continue to rise and become more common. Gun control laws can put a stop to the senseless mass killings of people. Assault weapon bans have more than a 6.8 effectiveness that is graded on a 10-point scale in reducing mass shootings (Ny times 2016). Gun control laws have been proven to reduce gun-related violence."

"I'll be the first to say this to you the AR in the AR 15 is the companies name, not Assault Rifle, also the definition of an assault rifle is a rifle that has a rapid-fire rate and a large mag, but aside from those gripes, everything else looks spot on. Semi-auto weapons can (And have been in the Las Vegas shooting) converted into fully automatic guns and semi-autos are just as dangerous and in some cases even more so because shooters don't burn through their ammo as quickly, bullpup and other closer quarter/urban guns are dangerous to have in urban environments."

"Automatic weapons are already regulated by the National Firearms act. You cannot buy an automatic gun with paying a annual tax every year and you can not transfer the machine gun (automatic) without going through paper work and reviews. Semi automatic rifles and pistols fir one round every time the trigger is pulled. Just to make sure that you know the difference. The military has automatic rifles. The local citizens does not."

"I believe we in the united states should have way more gun control laws. On the facts on how there are people just buying guns so they can kill one another let's put in reference in a black community and all the gangs going on around us today it's the fact that if someone doesn't like another human being then they think it's okay to just go around killing one another but that's not okay. If we had more gun control laws then it would be less crimes around us. There would be more back ground checks to whom can carry and be armed with a weapon. Yes, it is okay to have a weapon to make sure you are safe and nobody comes in and try's and hurts you but for the ones who just get guns because it looks cool and because they want to do harmful things then that is not okay so yes more guns laws would place the crime rates way down and if the laws were stricter then I believe the people will obey the nations laws way more. It would make our society today way safer and better with more gun laws and the right laws to be initiated."

"why not ban hi-cap magazines? if someone has three 30-round mags they can kill 90 people if someone with three 5-round mags (the same mag with a rivet so it can only hold 5) tries the same thing then they can kill 15 people its common sense to ban hi-cap mags which is why their banned here in cnada"

"A reply to Country, but why not try? Yes shooters have other options but why not try to limit them to make mass shootings harder, extra guns are harder to carry than extra mags, this means by banning hi-cap mags you can reduce the number of rounds they have and increase the chance they are apprehended before they can do more damage."

"I believe gun control laws should exist. Where gun control laws are in place, there is a very love murder rate, which has been proven by many statistic based studies. Many people argue guns can be used for protection, but there are a significant amount of scenarios in which they cannot be used for protection. If the access to a gun could cause fatalities then there should gun control laws in place."

""With approximately 30,000 men, women and children dying each year at the barrel of a gun in elementary schools, movie theaters, workplaces, houses of worship and on live television, the United States faces a public health crisis of gun violence... Our AMA 'recognizes that uncontrolled ownership and use of firearms, especially handguns, is a serious threat to the public's health inasmuch as the weapons are one of the main causes of intentional and unintentional injuries and deaths.' AMA policy supports legislation calling for a waiting period before purchasing any form of firearm in the U.S., and supports requiring background checks for all handgun purchasers."

"It is predicted that within this century that due to the ever increasing population that most, if not every, government with turn into some for a totalitarian government. By that point it won't matter who has gun control. Most likely in that situation all guns will be taken away and given to the military and defense, and not the general public. But until then, we shouldn't do that job by killing off ourselves with guns and wait for our future autocratic leader to do it. *cough, cough, D.T., cough cough*"

"Thomas Jefferson (Letter to James Madison): "On receiving it, [the Constitution], I wrote strongly to Mr. Madison, urging the want of provision for...the substitution of militia for a standing army..." He wrote that the 2nd amendment should to keep the right of state controlled militias over a standing country wide army, nothing about owning a gun for your own purpose. ?I'm not saying all guns should be banned, but at least very hard to get. You look at places like Japan and you realize they have extremely lower gun homicide and suicide rates. In Japan it is really hard to get a gun because they do a background check on not just you, but your whole family to make sure they aren't mentally ill, something Americans would never do even if it were an amendment in the constitution."

"If anything there needs to be some major reforms to the way gun control is handled. I'm practically clinically insane, don't ever show it in public, and I could buy an assault rifle and shoot up an orphanage just because they didn't do an extensive background check. I could even do it at a gun show or online because they don't care who you are. Many anti-gun control law supporters are saying that guns don't kill. For that, I want them to consider that having a gun sitting around on a table to see if it magically shoots somebody on its own, or if a human has to use it to shoot somebody in a normal situation. Basically, if you bring up the guns don't kill thing or the 2nd amendment, I will dismiss anything you say about them as bias and/or false, as should the sensible citizens of the nation."

"If your car needs to be registered, why shouldn't your guns? If all guns were registered, then someone would be the owner. If the gun is used in a crime, that someone would at least be the first place to look. The law should be changed to put the responsibility on the owner of record. When someone sells a gun, a transfer of ownership document is filled out and submitted to the [needs to be established] registry. Additionally, if you want to own a gun or 100 guns you must pass a background check and be certified to own a gun(s). Once certified, you may own as many guns as you like so long as they are properly registered. Transaction level background checks are stupid. You can only buy or sell guns to other certified persons or entities (like gun shops). Like a passport, you would need to re-certify every 10 years. There would need to be stiff penalties for non-compliance to include confiscation, fines and if the gun is used in a crime and was not legally reported lost, sold, stolen, or destroyed, then you would be charged with whatever the crime was that was committed with the gun. This would probably compel most gun owners to lock up their guns or risk running afoul of the law. Guns are the owners responsibility."

"With all these new stand your ground laws, you can easily get away with murder because you feel threatened by somebody else. You could kill somebody because he has a gun and could kill you even if there is no ammo with it and you have seen there's no ammo. Americans are effectively making rules that increase the genocide and homicides in America. They, we, are making it easier for the people who need to be institutionalized to gain access to a firearm so they can shoot up the nearest orphanage, school, or church because they feel threatened by nothing but the fact they exist."

"We have the right to bear arms but, people have taken it to far. People should not be carrying around assault rifles or pistols. The guns are only for protecting your house, or property. Not just to walk around shooting people. Making it to where NOBODY can have guns will make our world a better peaceful place."

"The term "assault rifles" was developed by pro-anti gun legislators. The fact that you call a gun an assault rifle is idiotic. For example, an AR15 is an armalite rifle hence AR, NOT assault rifle. Those are semi-automatic rifles that fire 223. and 5.56 rounds that are quite weak compared to many hunting calibers. Also pistols either concealed or open carry should only be carried by trained professionals or civilians that have undergone training. Those trained personnel will not fire unless fired upon or have positive identification of a shooter. Finally it is much easier to take fire arms from law abiding citizens rather then criminal. If you really think that gun men will just set their guns down and start singing kumbaya, then you are obviously ignorant to the real world. In fact, more concealed carriers would actually help cut down on shooting better that laws."

"I'm sorry but I consider my person my property at which I do have the right to defend and I can guarantee that responsible gun owners out there are not just walking around shooting people. something that I have learned over years of reading comments like this is that almost every anti gun person out there knows absolutely nothing about guns and honestly I would be scared to see someone like you own a gun. gun control does not create peace the proper hands and training creates peace."

"Taking away guns completely is not the answer. It'll limit our right to bear arms, and/or hunt. It'll make many people angry, start riots/protests, and cause more people to find ways to illegally use and manufacture guns. What we NEED is more in control and stricter laws for guns. We need a way to provide gun use without the fear of illegal use."

"+L.W.That would just create more social injustice. It'll create an imbalance between military and civilians. The military would have so much more power over other people outside of the military; which could start riots, and even possible civil wars within our country. Banning them completely wouldn't help either. People would find a way to illegally use and manufacture them. I agree that our gun control should be stricter and more under control."

"no matter what you do there are still things to kill with like wood steaks, hand crafted swords, knifes, vehicles, forks, spoons, pencils, all that stuff is things we need kind of like guns we need them to hunt for our food if we didnt have them we wouldnt be able to have meats for dinner. then how would we get meat, grind up chicken and say its steak.when we have no gun left we will have to use spears for hunting but then there will be people killing with those tooand you wouldnt be able to catch the guy who murderedso then you wont be saving people you would actually be losing family friends and local citezens faster than with guns"

"With all due respect, I'd like to see someone with a fork who can kill or wound dozens of people in a matter of seconds. Rifles with rapid-fire capabilities (thanks to bump stocks or the like) can fire up to nine rounds a second. They can cause so much more harm than any of the weapons you listed in much less time. Yes, people will still find ways to kill. We can still try to save as many lives as we can, and I think this is a poor excuse for not doing so."

"Just so you know, you don't need a gun to get meat for food, and if gun control laws were enacted, people wouldn't resort to hunting with spears and then go primitive and start killing people with those spears. In addition, hunting is usually only for recreation and not for practical uses, so having more strict gun laws wouldn't affect too many people in such a major way. Yes, I understand that some people hunt to survive and that some people hunt for recreational use often, but that also means that people are prioritizing their recreational activities over thousands of people getting murdered, which is so wrong I can't even begin to think about it."

If you are for gun control i hope i change your mind.1) "may 9th 2013 48% of convicted felons surveyed avoided committing crimes when they knew the victim was armed with a gun." And Wayne Lapierre executive president president of the NRA stated "The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." 2) of we let the government take away our guns that could result in government tyranny. It could be Hitler all over again! one of his quotes is "To conquer a nation, First disarm its citizens." i hope i changed your mind if you where for gun control with what i wrote?...typed?...Whatever. And no offence but like Mani said this is coming from a middle schooler.Hope you liked this."

"blaming guns for killing people is like blaming the ice cream for making you fat, when YOU are the one who keeps buying it from the store over and over. the problem isn't the guns, its the criminals with them. they decide to pull the trigger. also, murdering people is illegal, that doesn't stop criminals from killing people, so criminals would still get these guns illegally, and people who actually OBEY the laws wouldn't have as good guns to protect themselves. llike a criminal with a assault rifle gotten illegally goes up against a guy with a revolver, which holds less bullets, doesn't shoot as fast, and is not as powerful as an assault rifle. guns aren't responsible for killing. they cant get up on their own and say "man, I want to kill someone today!" its the person who uses the gun who decides to kill innocent people, to decide to pull the trigger, to decide to illegally get guns and murder, it is not the guns. it is the person who decides to use them irresponsibly."

"Yes all of the points you have made are valid, except the number of people killed by the person depends on the kind of gun they use, a person with a revolver holding six bullets is much less likely to kill as many as a person with an LMG that can hold over a hundred. It isn't the guns fault, but the gun holds a major influence on the amount of damage a gunman can do. This is why so many people want gun control, we can eliminate gun violence but we can reduce the effectiveness of it."

"Personally I despise firearms; I absolutely hate them, I wish they did not exist. But I am also absolutely opposed to gun "control", because firearms do exist and there is no way to control them, all that legislation can do is take firearms away from people who obey laws, there is no way whatsoever that a law can take guns out of the hands of those who wish to use them to kill, a law cannot take guns away from those that break laws. Therefor I will teach my kids as my dad taught me; I will teach my kids how to use, clean, assemble, care for, load and repair guns; I will also teach my kids, as my dad taught me, how to produce their own ammunitions', their own custom rounds and even how to make their own guns. But most importantly I will teach my kids (as my dad taught me) to respect guns, to never use a gun in anger, to never use a gun on another human being unless it is in the defense of their lives or the lives of others."

We need to be able to fight back if any of those cases do indeed happen and if it is hard to receive weapons those who are bad will still end up getting them. Yet, if we allow only militia certified officers to use guns that would be effective. then, bad people would use knives; or even other weapons that would hurt more. If we did do anything to change the second amendment we would end up with even worse outcomes."

"Imagine you live in the country, and the nearest police station is a 45 minute drive away. Now, imagine that your family is sleeping inside, and there is an intoxicated man coming in with an illegal gun. With strict gun regulations, you wouldn't be able to have a gun. You obeyed the law and got a gun legally. The person who came in got a gun illegally. With these gun regulations, you'd be dead before the police got there. You'd think: How dare you not let me defend my family. You'd rather me die here than have a gun in the case of self defense?"

"Universal background checks don't do anything the laws on our books already cover. You can't make someone go to a gun store to transfer a gun, all it allows you to do is arrest them after the crime if they are in illegal possession of a gun, which there are already laws federally that allow this.Assault weapons bans would infringe on too many sporting events including 3 Gun competitions where AR15s, shotguns, and pistols are used. It isn't just skeet and trap.Banning "high capacity magazines" aka standard capacity magazines would only lead to someone having to reload, which takes all of about 3 seconds. That is not enough time to tackle someone like many claim.Even with the laws on the books where it's ALREADY illegal for many criminals to own a gun, they still have guns. Criminals get their guns in three ways. The most common is through straw purchases, where they send someone to the gun store to buy a gun for them where they have to pass a background check, so another bg check would do nothing. The second is they steal their guns, it doesn't matter how good of a safe you have if someone wants it they'll steal it. The third way is the black market, and they get on the black market from ways 1 and 2."

"Personally, I think there should be no more gun laws than there already is. Many people on the other side of the argument think that the guns are the problem, they are dead wrong. A gun is an object that does not think, or act. The people behind the guns that abuse their right are the problem, its the same situation it has been for eternity. We have seen how this is gone with prohibition, if we try to remove this right or add petty laws to our gun rights more and more people will still make, buy, sell, and use guns. When I see a person with a concealed and carry in a public place, I feel just as safe and if not more safe than i was before. The people who go around robbing people and businesses and killing in cold blood are mostly never these people. Most gun owners who are responsible have lived their lives around gun safety and do not abuse their power. America was built off of citizens owning guns and it is our god given right to own as many legal guns as we please, they help us save lives, hunt for food, sport and many other responsible reasons. We should leave our gun rights alone."

Someone who might be mentally or psychically ill get possession of a gun could get out of control so if others have a gun the they will be able to protect themselves."

"I think we don't need to take all the guns away, due to that it's the people causing the problems, not guns. We should be sending more people to jail for their doings, not guns. We are the ones controlling the guns and what they do, not itself. If we shot it's us, not the guns doing it. We are the ones who make the choices of shooting people on the streets and in schools, cars, buildings, e.t.d. We need to control ourselves. We are just the people who have one."

"This is madness. I believe strongly that gun violence is not the guns fault. It is the people who chose to make the poor decisions and carry on causing terror and chaos in this country. Will stricter gun laws help? Of course not, in fact it would boost the people to want to own a gun even more therefore boosting crime rate. Mexico is a great example of this. With its almost 11500 gun murders a year, it only had 1 legal gun store and strict government regulations yer the common people in Mexico own over 15000000 guns combined."

To me guns aren't the tools which is used to harm others,they're Defensive Weapons and Sports Equipment.Shooting is my favorite sports,a perfect sport rifle is necessity,I don't want a air rifle,that's not accurate at all."

"Who can possibly be naive enough to think that having more rules, more laws, policies, guns for 'protection' (illusion), more 'gun control legislation, more police, more militant aggression would stop terror. It won't whatsoever!Are we going to try to control pressure cookers, axes, hammers, anything a lunatic could use to do bad deeds?This has turned into irrational paranoia. Public announcements: "Be aware [wary] of your surroundings" "Report suspicious activity". "Report unattended bags or parcels". I wonder what this tells visitors to this country.No matter how many laws, regulations, ordinances, etc. 'lawmakers' can dream up, bad people are going to do bad things.Background checks may weed out some bad apples, but obviously we can't delude ourselves that this would create world peace.Some people right now are not willing, or may not even be ready to take responsibility for their own lives, much less that of the health of our planet.We've all been adding fuel to the flame.If we all make the effort to improve our moral character (and it will indeed take considerable effort for many), perhaps there would be no need for excessive rules, laws, regulations, etc."

"I hope you understand that restricting thugs is not the point of gun control. It is so that people turned bad can't get their hands on military grade firearms and mass murder several people. Yes, restricting guns won't change that fact that criminals will still get their hands on them, but at least it makes it harder. It is much easier to restrict guns than tell everyone and expect everyone to "make the effort to improve our moral character." That is an unreasonable expectation of people and gun control is a much simpler and agreeable answer."

"Even though I agree that gun control laws needs to be more strict and enforced, simply saying no guns is not going to help. People still needs to protect themselves. Criminals will get their guns no matter how many laws we pass to restrict guns. Guns should be allowed to be possessed by normal citizens, but they should be kept at home and not be allowed to be brought out in public. Only authorities should be allowed to carry guns in public. This would protect citizens at home and at public areas at the same time while the authorities are still carrying guns for criminal activity. Even though this idea still has some problems, it will help decrease mass shootings in the US."

"a lot of people rely on guns to feed their families via hunting, weather it be selling game, eating game, both, etc. if gun control is passed, it will be a lot harder if not impossible to hunt. also, if you are hunting, you cant kill a bear or a deer with a wimpy little handgun. you would need bigger guns like a high powered rifle, or a shotgun. people fear guns much more than knives, and knives are often regarded as "survival tools," when knives kill at least 2x more people per year than guns do! also, there are more deaths by vending machines each year than by shark attacks. people are afraid of sharks, and not afraid of vending machines. most gather that shark attacks are rare from this. so is gun deaths. there are more gun deaths by suicide by anything else! you don't see suicide being illegalized. granted, most people will argue against suiciding, but you get my point. in conclusion, gun control is a horrible idea. I REST MY CASE."

"The gun is not the problem. The person behind the gun is. Instead of taking away the right to bear arms or the right to protect ourselves, our family or our president, promote stiffer penalties for those who use the gun to inflect pain or cause death for the sheer power of doing so. I understand that so many of these gun users have mental or depression problems, but what about the families that are left behind. Drug are illegal but can be found everywhere. The fine for drug usage or sales can be hefty. Does not stop it from being a nationwide problem? Taking away all guns will never happen. It will only make it harder for a law abiding citizen to obtain one but not impossible. Let the punishment of those that use the gun to kill without provocation fit the crime. I question why those who are without a doubt guilty of killing in mass are allowed to serve life in prison. Then if they are to be put to death why it takes so long. I believe that the moment they planned and then pulled a trigger, they should lose all their rights as an American citizen. They should be treated as any other terrorist who inflicts the terror of late. There are always ways to kill. Strongly penalize the killer, not the way it way done."

"Guns are hard to keep track of, but we know The United States has a lot of them. According to a Small Arms Survey there are roughly 112 guns per 100 citizens, over 300,000,000 Legal guns. Imagine the number of guns that would circulate in the black market even if there was a full gun ban. The CDC did a study and found that firearms are a great crime deterrent. In the study, they found that the number of lives saved by firearms greatly outweighs the number of those taken. How many mass shootings happened in no gun zones? What if three armed men broke into your house? Only law abiding citizens obey strict gun laws. Murderers are criminals, every murderer has broken a law. If you're willing to commit a crime like murder, odds are you're not worried about having a firearm with banned features. Even all the regulation, background checks, and peeping-tom-fbi agents couldn't do anything about the unfortunate number of mass shootings we've been having recently. The founding fathers escaped hell and wanted their children to have the same opportunities they had. You may be comfortable now, but without the perspective of history you'll never understand how quickly things can change."

"Detroit has some of the strictest gun control laws in the country, and also the second highest murder rate. It's the same with Chicago and many other cities; there is direct correlation between the strictness of the laws and crime rates, and that's a fact. If we illegalize guns, then the law-abiding citizens will no longer have them as means of protection, whereas criminals, regardless, will find ways to illegally obtain guns. It's true that a lot of tragic accidents can occur with the presence of more guns, but is the government really going to take away my right to bear arms because somebody else forgot to lock the door to his safe? Don't punish the good people of the United States by taking away their ability to defend themselves, simply because some people make poor decisions, because that will always be the case. In doing so, the government will be subjecting U.S. families, schools, and communities to much greater risk.""

"Guns don't kill people, people kill people. Guns are used and have been used for centuries as means for hunting so that people could feed their families and as self-defense. Do you really want to be unarmed if someone comes into your home and threatens the lives of your family. Guns are for safety purposes and whether or not you want to pinpoint what the Second Amendment says about the Militia it clearly states that the right of the people to keep and bare arms shall not be infringed. This was put into the constitution for a reason. People deserve to have the security of knowing they can protect themselves in an emergency. You know how to solve this problem. Everyone needs to put Jesus back in their lives!"

"Gun control by definition is a violation of the second amendment. "the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed''. If more people had guns the world would be a safer place. Good people die when they can't defend themselves. Criminals wouldn't obey any gun control laws, that's why they are criminals. I wish that the teachers in my school and other schools had guns in the classrooms, that would not only protect themselves and the kids but would help deter the people who thought about shooting up those areas. An argument I hear people try to make a lot is just call the police and my answer is very simple. Lets say it takes police 1 minute to get to you, now that is faster than reality in most cases but we'll use it. the scenario, you are being held at gunpoint, what do you do? Tell the attacker to wait one second so you can call the police? That will never work. If you cannot defend yourself bad guys will prey off of that. Now if you choose not to use your right that is your business, but do not tell law abiding citizens they cannot defend themselves and their loved ones.Also If the government becomes corrupt the people have the right to overthrow/abolish that government and make a new.They need to be able to"

"Gun Control is a nice sound but the details can never be agreed upon. What is "gun control" and why isn't the control we have currently enough? Any proposed legislation should be required to demonstrate a direct, measurable and verifiable link to a reduction in its proposed benefit. Not "feel good" statements that have no truth or verifiability in them but a clear and compelling measurable benefit. After all, we are speaking of a fundamental right and restricting it. For those who support "gun control", I would ask them if they would restrict cars because there are drunk driving deaths everyday. I would ask them to demonstrate the consistency in their logic, particularly since car ownership is not a fundamental and protected right."

"When a child pokes another child with a pencil, you take away THEIR pencil, not all pencils. When you have a nurse room full of kids complaining about getting stabbed with pencils, you don't ban pencils, you find the guy doing it and punish him.Banning guns has been shown to NOT reduce crime.Increasing gun ownership rates HAS been shown to reduce crime.Accidental gun deaths are the highest type of gun death in the US. This would be fixed by educating children about firearm usage and safety in their classroom."

"Sadly mass killers have used all types of firearms, pistol, hunting rifles, shotguns and military style weapons with equal success. More mass shootings involve pistols than these "assault rifles".Assault rifles are functionally identical to semi automatic hunting rifles and typical less powerful. It is practically impossible to legally define what an "assault weapon" is which leads to specific cosmetic feature bans that are totally ineffective. Politicians still like to use the strategy as it appears to address a problem while not targeting "legitimate" gun owners. In fact it accomplishes nothing.It amounts to banning red cars in order to reduce traffic deaths."

"You want gun control because guns kill people, right? So, with that thinking, we should also have knife control, because knives kill people! Oh, and don't forget car control, Yeah, cars can kill many, you see them drive into crowds. We should also have rope control, people strangle other people with them! In the minds of many, if it can kill, it needs regulation. Because we would all want to live in a world where safety scissors are considered weapons of mass destruction."

"I am con on gun laws my reasons being is because more gun laws really won't make a drastic change in all the crime. It's been shown relatively few people are killed by guns. People can still purchase weapons illegally like how they've been doing for years, it's not about gun control but about gun ownership responsibility. We need to focus more on education about gun safety because gun control laws not only infringe our basic amendment but also have been proven to not be that effective. Mexico has stricter laws than the United States but in 2012 they had 11,309 gun murders."

"Gun control in a way that tries to restrict the firearm a person can own is not a good thing. The Second Amendment in the U.S. Constitution says "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." Therefore I as a person have the right to own a firearm not me as a Militia because the Amendment says Militia and people in separate parts of the Amendment. I understand that with this right there is some limitations such as every other right. This right should not have a lot of limitations just like the freedom of speech. The limitations on freedom of speech is for the safety of the people. Me being a sane citizen of this country should be able to own a gun with the limitation that I won't do anything to harm someone with it; not the limitation on if my gun can hold a lot of bullets or if it can shoot fast. In the First Amendment it doesn't say that a person has the freedom of speech unless they have a big mouth or are too loud. People should not have restrictions on their right to bear arms depending on the gun."

"If we made Gun Laws, that still wouldn't change the fact that there is a Black Market for people to buy guns illegally from, and people who do get them are either going to shoot someone, or they are going to try and shoot as many people as they can in a public place, like a Mall, a Store, a Bank, or a School."

"No they shouldn't. Guns are there as the ultimate defense of our freedom and liberty. It won't stop senseless killings st schools as many people think. People will just start driving cars into crowds or using machetes etc.. If you want to stop the school killings you need to get to the root of the problem. These kids are the outcasts and unknowns. With all the social media this is far worse than it's ever been. So they crack and POOF they are famous. If you deleted every social media page and the news never said. Their names or showed their picture, the incentive to do the shootings would dissapear."

"Gun control doesn't work in a lot of cases, for example France (that has nearly the same political system we do) has major gun problems and they have all firearms banned, along with Britain and their gun violence rate has exceeded New York's knife violence rate. Countries that have kept peace between people and have the same gun laws in America, maybe even have more lenient gun laws are Switzerland and Canada. The reason I believe that there is a higher gun crime rate in America is because or the media. In Canada they report happier, more relaxed news, in America it's "Lock your door a killer is out there". People trust each other in Canada and Switzerland. We don't need to work on the gun laws, we need to work on the fear factor and how corrupt the media is, because they choose to report this. We need to work on building trust in the community rather than fighting with someone over something like, "you shouldn’t be allowed to own and AR-15.""

The Truth
Aug. 31, 2018
"The gun control people want isn't going to change the problems we currently have in America. Annually there are about 2.4 million defensive uses of firearms. If we limit guns then it only makes it easier for the criminal. I agree that people should be required to have safe and secure gun storage; However, it should already be this way. It's common sense to keep your guns safe and secure. What most people don't understand is that most gun owners are good gun owners. We could be like Italy and have someone run down many people with a delivery truck or like Japan where a kid walked into a school to stab and kill 17 students. The Florida school shooting also had 17 kids die. So does that mean guns and knives are just as effective as each other? obviously no, but it still stands that if someone wants to commit a murder spree they will."

""cause of homicides" -- "cause of suicides" -- REALLY? Funny thing - here in Pittsburgh, a man was arrested the other day carrying an AR-15 in his backpack -- the dang gun was stolen -- so there he was -- likely a repeat criminal -- with one of those semi-automatic things -- and you know what??? Not a single person died -- though we were all sure it was going to happen -- that stolen AR-15 just sat there in his backpack and did nothing. So the numbers you present here -- guns are the 12th highest cause of death -- sorry -- and the #1 cause of homicide?? maybe a gun is the instrument a criminal uses to commit homicide -- and the #1 instrument to commit suicide, but I certainly would love for someone to show me how guns CAUSED either. A suicidal person uses a gun because it is the most lethal, painless, and effective method of suicide. Take all the guns away -- do you think that person isn't going to find another way?? Hogwash!"

"George W. Bush argued: "I... believe strongly that we need to enforce the laws on the books....(New York limes, 2000, p. A26)." The need for regulation falls upon the United States Congress, which has refused to end an important loophole to gun control. One reason gun controls fail to endure are the Unregulated Secondary Firearm Markets. These markets are not subject to federal requirements and are essentially the primary reason the guns fall on to the wrong hands. "A recent analysis of 1,530 ATF firearms-trafficking investigations revealed that traffickers operating in both markets illegally diverted new and second-hand firearms within states and across state lines (ATF, 2000a)." While these markets are not required to formally record the transactions, the law prohibits the private sellers to transfer the firearms to individuals that are not granted the opportunity to obtain a fire arm such felons, fugitives, drug users, and illegal aliens. However, these private transactions do not partake in criminal background checks of the person purchasing the firearms, so it is very difficult to obtain any essential information about the potential buyer of the firearm."

"I do understand the need for regulation as well as the desire to minimize devastation; a noble goal indeed. However, these regulations towards firearms would prove fruitless in the future because of the need for self-defense. Even a gun-control advocate by the name of Senator Dianne Feinstein had carried a concealed weapon when her home was attacked by a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist organization known as the New World Liberation Front in the 70s. People have defended their lives with guns for much longer than the 2nd Amendment has existed in this country. If the NRA is to be believed, guns are used for self-defense about 2.5 million times a year. Furthermore, a survey in early 2013 showed that 48% of convicted felons admitted to avoiding crimes where they knew the potential victim had a gun present.While there are many people who have lost their lives due to guns, I cannot forget the plenty who are alive because of them. To be fair though, guns are like a catch-22 within this nation. If you have guns, many will die from them. If you don't have guns, many will also die without them. It's honestly like choosing between prostate cancer and late-stage rabies."

"Gun control in theory doesn't help anyone but the criminals. What needs to be understood is that whether we have gun control or we don't, the criminals are going to get guns either way. The gun control is only hurting the law abiding citizen that wants to be able to conceal carry his/her firearm to be able to protect his/her self and his/her family. Another thing not being mentioned is that the gun is not what is killing people, its people killing people: we need to understand that taking guns away or restricting them will not stop people from killing each other. We need to focus more on the mental health issue in this country."

"Absolutely not. Why is it that as soon as a tragedy occurs, the first thing from the Democrats is the call for more gun control. Have any of them checked on how many gun laws are already in existence? The problem is not the guns, they are an inanimate object until a person deliberately picks one up, deliberately loads it, and deliberately points it at someone or something and deliberately pulls the trigger. What we have is a terrible disease - the lack of morals! It's all about what I want right now, the hell with everything or everyone else. Until we can change the values of people, we are always going to have issues. Blaming an object and subsequently restricting or banning it will not fix the problem. If more guns laws are the answer, then why is crime so rampant in Washington DC, Chicago, and elsewhere that have extreme gun laws in existence?"

"More laws and regulations aren't the answer. It's like trying to ban "mosquitos". The world is full of them, they are dangerous, potentially lethal and more are made every day like guns. It is an impossibility. You can only try to protect against it, you can't go out into the world and kill every mosquito any more than you'll ever go out into the world and take every gun. We should all think about what "laws" and "regulations" really do to stop these monsters who do these shootings? Nothing, it's going to change nothing. You anti gun fanatics are not helping anything either. Every time someone starts up about gun control, sales go through the roof! Seriously people! This is not working for You! We need protection in our schools and public places where these atrocities occur. We need a real solution, not the same old regurgitated anti gun nonsense that you've spewed for years and have accomplished the "opposite" of your goal. The fact is, the guns are out there and you'll never change that. To think you can change that is insanity and is the "BIGGEST WASTE OF TIME" If we would all focus on finding a way to protect our schools, rather than impose laws that only law abiding citizens will follow? You think Cruz cared about the law? No"

"Guns have been a part of our culture since the foundation of this country and it's very unique ideology. The article states that there are, what, 270,000,000 guns in the United States? If the guns themselves were the problem, it would be a lot bigger of an issue than it is. As far as the gun related deaths go, over half of them were acts of suicide. If people want to kill someone, including themselves, they will find a way to do so. A gun is a tool, just like a shovel or an axe, and it's only as dangerous as the person using it."

"The right to own a gun is part of a natural right to self-defense and is protected by the 2nd and 14th amendment. But, no right is unlimited. I believe guns should be restricted from people who have anger and self-control issues and mentally ill individuals. But, the Gun Control Act of 1968 made it illegal for the certain categories of people to own a gun. It includes indicted or convicted felons, convicted domestic abusers, dishonorably discharged veterans and people the court declared mentally defective. Aside from enforcing current laws or magically making all the guns in the world disappear, the most effective way to reduce gun deaths would be for the public to be more aware of the existing gun laws and commonsense gun safety rules. 40 years ago, drunk driving was more common. Groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving campaigned to raise awareness of the dangers. Didn't solve the problem. But, helped. If people were more aware of gun safety rules and knew the warning signs to look for in mentally ill individuals as well as what to do if you were worried about a gunowner's mental health then there would be fewer deaths."

"I don't believe gun control is the issue, something needs to be done no question there. I'm just not sure it's about gun control. The violence is all around us, it's in the music, the movies, tv shows, video games... All of these are common factors and can't be ruled out how much influence they play a part.The media has to accept some responsibility, they glorify the crimes by continually reporting it, (rather than report it and move on, they dwell on it) They give the "gunmen" the publicity. Why mention the names of the killers? Take away the publicity, some of these crimes are committed because these people want this attention, they want to be "remembered"Guns are the instrument, sure. But look in the past couple of years you are noticing more and more mass killings with other instruments, like the guy in New York than ran people over with his truck. So, do we ban trucks now?The argument on gun control is neither right or wrong, everyone will have their own view points. But, if guns are gone, other methods of harming each other will be found."

"There are many good reasons of why gun control is good. Because with out gun control there would be lots of bad things happening. For example with out gun control laws there would non reduced gun deaths. Meaning that there would be more gun deaths. Also they will be more likely not to be used for self - defense. And lastly the second amendment is not unlimited with there rights of a gun. First of all I think that there should be a old enough to handle a gun. And that gun control has been around just as old or older than the second amendment. So it should be more controlled now then, it was then. Another reason is that with out gun control laws the reduced gun death is going to get higher. But if there is a sure understanding of the gun control laws the gun death is going to get lower. It's getting higher because in 1999 over 464,033 people were killed because of there not being gun control. This is really bad because with out gun control there is going to be even more people getting killed. Also meaning that it's going to get worst. Lastly if there is no gun control people are rarely use there gun as self defense. In 1999-2007 29,618,300 crimes were committed because there was no gun control."

"We only need gun control for idiots out there that decide murder is fun and an option for getting what they want. We DO NOT need the government in our business and they need to STAY out of it. Guns should be used for hunting and safety. I hunt and I have guns but they are safe and sound with locks and more locks. We need to teach about safety of the gun, especially to our children. Guns don't kill people, people kill people and with what? A gun! The criminals will get a hold of a gun however strict they make the laws. They don't care one way or another about the laws, obviously. People we need common sense and making the government get more control is crazy. What ever happen to "We the people?" We have rights and we need to stand tall and fight for them and speak out!"

"If you look at the past shootings that have happened in the U.S., you would see that the people that committed the murders had some sort of mental illness. Some may have been criminals getting ahold of a gun or it could have been some teen or adult that had a mental illness. The guns are not the problem. criminals and ill people will still find ways to get to guns if they are banned. there is no stop to the wicked besides death, and even then there will always be evil people in the world. There is no stop to gun violence."

"People who think that gun control is good is crazy. Guns help you get duck meat, venison, elk meat is all possible with guns. Yes for the bad people who use the guns for bad is part of it but no matter what they would somehow find out how to get guns. It is a BIG INDUSTRY in Mexico with unmarked and remade guns. So that means that means that they would be armed to the teeth with guns. And we would be hung up to dry with none. So what's the point of gun control if criminals would be getting guns no matter what."

"One good reason for NO. When has the government ever given back. They just keep taking more and more. This is what will happen with gun rights. Chip away a little at a time until there is nothing left. Just like our wallets..."

GUN CONTROL
Last updated on: 12/18/2018 10:16:24 AM PST
Background of the Issue
"Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
(click to enlarge image)
Infographic illustrating the attributes of the average American gun owner.
The United States has 120.5 guns per 100 people, or about 393,347,000 guns, which is the highest total and per capita number in the world. 22% of Americans own one or more guns (35% of men and 12% of women). America's pervasive gun culture stems in part from its colonial history, revolutionary roots, frontier expansion, and the Second Amendment, which states: "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
Proponents of more gun control laws state that the Second Amendment was intended for militias; that gun violence would be reduced; that gun restrictions have always existed; and that a majority of Americans, including gun owners, support new gun restrictions.
Opponents say that the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to own guns; that guns are needed for self-defense from threats ranging from local criminals to foreign invaders; and that gun ownership deters crime rather than causes more crime.
Guns in Colonial and Revolutionary America
Guns were common in the American Colonies, first for hunting and general self-protection and later as weapons in the American Revolutionary War. [105] Several colonies' gun laws required that heads of households (including women) own guns and that all able-bodied men enroll in the militia and carry personal firearms. [105]
Some laws, including in Connecticut (1643) and at least five other colonies, required "at least one adult man in every house to carry a gun to church or other public meetings" in order to protect against attacks by Native Americans; prevent theft of firearms from unattended homes; and, as a 1743 South Carolina law stated, safeguard against "insurrections and other wicked attempts of Negroes and other Slaves." [105] Other laws required immigrants to own guns in order to immigrate or own land. [105]
The Second Amendment of the US Constitution was ratified on Dec. 15, 1791. The notes from the Constitutional Convention do not mention an individual right to a gun for self-defense. [106] Some historians suggest that the idea of an individual versus a collective right would not have occurred to the Founding Fathers because the two were intertwined and inseparable: there was an individual right in order to fulfill the collective right of serving in the militia. [105] [106]
Although guns were common in colonial and revolutionary America, so were gun restrictions. Laws included banning the sale of guns to Native Americans (though colonists frequently traded guns with Native Americans for goods such as corn and fur); banning indentured servants (mainly the Irish) and slaves from owning guns; and exempting a variety of professions from owning guns (including doctors, school masters, lawyers, and millers). [105]

A 1792 federal law required that every man eligible for militia service own a gun and ammunition suitable for military service, report for frequent inspection of their guns, and register his gun ownership on public records. [101] Many Americans owned hunting rifles or pistols instead of proper military guns, and even though the penalty fines were high (over $9,000 in 2014 dollars), they were levied inconsistently and the public largely ignored the law. [105] [106]
State Gun Laws: Slave Codes and the "Wild West"
From the 1700s through the 1800s, so-called "slave codes" and, after slavery was abolished in 1865, "black codes" (and, still later, "Jim Crow" laws) prohibited black people from owning guns and laws allowing the ownership of guns frequently specified "free white men." [98] For example, an 1833 Georgia law stated, "it shall not be lawful for any free person of colour in this state, to own, use, or carry fire arms of any description whatever… that the free person of colour, so detected in owning, using, or carrying fire arms, shall receive upon his bare back, thirty-nine lashes, and that the fire arm so found in the possession of said free person of colour, shall be exposed for public sale." [107]
Despite images of the "Wild West" from movies, cities in the frontier often required visitors to check their guns with the sheriff before entering the town. [108] In Oct. 1876, Deadwood, Dakota Territory passed a law stating that no one could fire a gun without the mayor's consent. [109] A sign in Dodge City, Kansas in 1879 read, "The Carrying of Fire Arms Strictly Prohibited." [108] The first law passed in Dodge City was a gun control law that read "any person or persons found carrying concealed weapons in the city of Dodge or violating the laws of the State shall be dealt with according to law." [108]
Federal Gun Laws in the 1900s
The St. Valentine's Day Massacre on Feb. 14, 1929 in Chicago resulted in the deaths of seven gangsters associated with "Bugs" Moran (an enemy of Al Capone) and set off a series of debates and laws to ban machine guns. [110] [111] Originally enacted in 1934 in response to mafia crimes, the National Firearms Act (NFA) imposes a $200 tax and a registration requirement on the making and transfer of certain guns, including shotguns and rifles with barrels shorter than 18 inches ("short-barreled"), machine guns, firearm mufflers and silencers, and specific firearms labeled as "any other weapons" by the NFA. [112] [113] Most guns are excluded from the Act.
The Federal Firearms Act of 1938 made it illegal to sell guns to certain people (including convicted felons) and required federal firearms licensees (FFLs; people who are licensed by the federal government to sell firearms) to maintain customer records. [114] This Act was overturned by the 1968 Gun Control Act.

Former Reagan Press Secretary Jim Brady sits by President BIll Clinton as Clinton signs the Brady Bill into law on Nov. 30, 1993
Source: Eric Bradner, "Hinckley Won't Face New Charges in Reagan Press Secretary's Death," www.cnn.com, Jan 3, 2015 In 1968 the National Firearms Act was revised to address constitutionality concerns brought up by Haynes v. US (1968), namely that unregistered firearms already in possession of the owner do not have to be registered, and information obtained from NFA applications and registrations cannot be used as evidence in a criminal trial when the crime occurred before or during the filing of the paperwork. [112]
On Oct. 22, 1968, prompted by the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy (1963), Malcolm X (1965), Martin Luther King, Jr. (1968), and Robert F. Kennedy (1968), as well as the 1966 University of Texas mass shooting, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA) into law. [115] The GCA regulates interstate gun commerce, prohibiting interstate transfer unless completed among licensed manufacturers, importers, and dealers, and restricts gun ownership. [114]
The Firearm Owners' Protection Act of 1986 (FOPA) revised prior legislation once again. [112] [113] The Act, among other revisions to prior laws, allowed gun dealers to sell guns away from the address listed on their license; limited the number of inspections the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (now the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) could perform without a warrant; prevented the federal government from maintaining a database of gun dealer records; and removed the requirement that gun dealers keep track of ammunition sales. [114]
The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 (also called the Brady Act) was signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993 and required a five-day waiting period for a licensed seller to hand over a gun to an unlicensed person in states without an alternate background check system. [116] The five-day waiting period has since been replaced by an instant background check system that can take up to three days if there is an inconsistency or more information is needed to complete the sale. [114] Gun owners who have a federal firearms license or a state-issued permit are exempt from the waiting period. [114]
The Federal Assault Weapons Ban (Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act), part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on Sep. 13, 1994. The ban outlawed 19 models of semi-automatic assault weapons by name and others by "military features," as well as large-capacity magazines manufactured after the law's enactment. [114] The ban expired on Sep. 13, 2004 and was not renewed due in part to NRA lobbying efforts. [114] [117]
Federal and State Gun Laws in the 2000s
Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and Child Safety Lock Act of 2005 was enacted on Oct. 26 by President George W. Bush and gives broad civil liability immunity to firearms manufacturers so they cannot be sued by a gun death victim's family. [114] [118] The Child Safety Lock Act requires that all handguns be sold with a "secure gun storage or safety device."[119]
The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 was enacted as a condition of the Brady Act and provides incentives to states (including grants from the Attorney General) for them to provide information to NICS including information on people who are prohibited from purchasing firearms. [114] The NICS was implemented on Nov. 30, 1998 and later amended on Jan. 8, 2008 in response to the Apr. 16, 2007 Virginia Tech University shooting so that the Attorney General could more easily acquire information pertinent to background checks such as disqualifying mental conditions. [120]
On Jan. 5, 2016, President Obama announced new executive actions on gun control. His measures take effect immediately and include: an update and expansion of background checks (closing the "gun show loophole"); the addition of 200 ATF agents; increased mental health care funding; $4 million and personnel to enhance the National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (used to link crimes in one jurisdiction to ballistics evidence in another); creating an Internet Investigations Center to track illegal online gun trafficking; a new Department of Health and Human Services rule saying that it is not a HIPAA violation to report mental health information to the background check system; a new requirement to report gun thefts; new research funding for gun safety technologies; and more funding to train law enforcement officers on preventing gun casualties in domestic violence cases.

In addition to federal gun laws, each state has its own set of gun laws ranging from California with the most restrictive gun laws in the country to Arizona with the most lenient, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the Brady Campaign's "2013 State Scorecard." [121]. 43 of 50 states have a "right to bear arms" clause in their state constitutions. [101]
The most common state gun control laws include background checks, waiting periods, and registration requirements to purchase or sell guns. [121] [122] Most states prevent carrying guns, including people with a concealed carry permit, on K-12 school grounds and many states prevent carrying on college campuses. [121] [122] Some states ban assault weapons. [121] [122]
Gun rights laws include concealed and open carry permits, as well as allowing gun carry in usually restricted areas (such as bars, K-12 schools, state parks, and parking areas). [121] [122] Many states have "shoot first" (also called "stand your ground") laws. [121] [122] Open carry of handguns is generally allowed in most states (though a permit may be required). [121] [122]
Collective v. Individual Right: Guns and the Supreme Court
Until 2008, the Supreme Court repeatedly upheld a collective right (that the right to own guns is for the purpose of maintaining a militia) view of the Second Amendment, concluding that the states may form militias and regulate guns. [47]
The first time the Court upheld an individual rights interpretation (that individuals have a Constitutional right to own a gun regardless of militia service) of the Second Amendment was the June 26, 2008 US Supreme Court ruling in DC v. Heller. The Court stated that the right could be limited: "There seems to us no doubt, on the basis of both text and history, that the Second Amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms. Of course the right was not unlimited… Thus we do not read the Second Amendment to protect the right of citizens to carry arms for any sort of confrontation, just as we do not read the First Amendment to protect the right of citizens to speak for any purpose." [1] [3]

The US Supreme Court ruled on June 28, 2010 in McDonald v. Chicago that the Fourteenth Amendment, specifically the Due Process Clause, includes the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and, thus, the Second Amendment applies to the states as well as the federal government, effectively extending the individual rights interpretation of the Second Amendment to the states. [123]
On June 27, 2016, in Voisine v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled (6-2) that someone convicted of "recklessly" committing a violent domestic assault can be disqualified from owning a gun under the 1996 Lautenberg Amendment to the 1968 Gun Control Act. Associate Justice Elena Kagan, JD, writing the majority opinion, stated: "Congress enacted §922(g)(9) [the Lautenberg Amendment] in 1996 to bar those domestic abusers convicted of garden-variety assault or battery misdemeanors--just like those convicted of felonies--from owning guns." [150] [151] [152] [153]
On Feb. 20, 2018, the US Supreme Court indicated it would not hear an appeal to California's 10-day waiting period for gun buyers, thus leaving the waiting period in place. [156] Justice Clarence Thomas said the Court should have heard the challenge, stating "The right to keep and bear arms is apparently this Court's constitutional orphan," in reference to the Court not hearing a major Second Amendment case since 2010. [156]
The National Rifle Association (NRA)
The National Rifle Association calls itself "America's longest-standing civil rights organization." [124] Granted charter on Nov. 17, 1871 in New York, Civil War Union veterans Colonel William C. Church and General George Wingate founded the NRA to "promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis" to improve the marksmanship of Union troops. [125] General Ambrose Burnside, governor of Rhode Island (1866 to 1869) and US Senator (Mar. 4, 1875 to Sep. 13, 1881), was the first president. [125] [126]
Over 100 years later, in 1977, in what is known as the "Revolt at Cincinnati," new leadership changed the bylaws to make the protection of the Second Amendment right to bear arms the primary focus (ousting the focus on sportsmanship). [127] [128] The group lobbied to disassemble the Gun Control Act of 1968 (the NRA alleged the Act gave power to the ATF that was abused), which they accomplished in 1986 with the Firearms Owners Protection Act. [127]
In 1993 the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) funded a study completed by Arthur Kellerman and colleagues, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, titled "Gun Ownership as a Risk Factor in the Home," which found that keeping a gun at home increased the risk of homicide. [129] [130] [131] The NRA accused the CDC of "promoting the idea that gun ownership was a disease that needed to be eradicated," and argued that government funding should not be available to politically motivated studies. [129] [130] [131] The NRA notched a victory when Congress passed the Dickey Amendment, which deducted $2.6 billion from the CDC's budget, the exact amount of its gun research program, and restricted CDC (and, later, NIH) gun research. [129] [130] [131] The amendment stated that "none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control." [129] [130] [131] The admonition effectively stopped all federal gun research because, as Kellerman stated, "[p]recisely what was or was not permitted under the clause was unclear. But no federal employee was willing to risk his or her career or the agency's funding to find out." [130] Jay Dickey (R-AR), now retired from Congress, was the author of the Dickey Amendment and has since stated that he no longer supports the amendment: "I wish we had started the proper research and kept it going all this time... I have regrets." [144]
As of Jan. 2013, the NRA had approximately 3 million members, though estimates have varied from 2.6 million to 5 million members. [132] In 2013 the NRA spending budget was $290.6 million. [133] The NRA-ILA actively lobbies against universal checks and registration, "large" magazine and "assault weapons" bans, requiring smart gun features, ballistic fingerprinting, firearm traces, and prohibiting people on the terrorist watchlist from owning guns; and in favor of self-defense (stand your ground) laws. [134] In 2014 the NRA and NRA-ILA spent $3.36 million on lobbying activity aimed primarily at Congress but also the US Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Army Corps of Engineers, and the Forest Service. [135]
The Gun Control Lobby
The start of the modern gun control movement is largely attributed to Mark Borinsky, PhD, who founded the National Center to Control Handguns (NCCH) in 1974. [136] After being the victim of an armed robbery, Borinsky looked for a gun control group to join but found none, founded NCCH, and worked to grow the organization with Edward O. Welles, a retired CIA officer, and N.T. "Pete" Shields, a Du Pont executive whose son was shot and killed in 1975. [136]

In 2001, after a few name changes, the National Center to Control Handguns (NCCH) was renamed the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and its sister organization, the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, was renamed the Brady Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, though they are often referred to collectively as the Brady Campaign. [137] The groups were named for Jim Brady, a press secretary to President Ronald Reagan who was shot and permanently disabled on Mar. 30, 1981 during an assassination attempt on the President. [137]
The 2014 gun control lobby was composed of Everytown for Gun Safety, Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, Sandy Hook Promise, Americans for Responsible Solutions, and Violence Policy Center. [138] Collectively, these groups spent $1.94 million in 2014, primarily aimed at Congress but also the Executive Office of the President, the Vice President, the White House, Department of Justice, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. [138]
The most-recently available total annual spending budgets for gun control groups were $13.7 million collectively (4.7% of the NRA's 2013 budget): including Everytown for Gun Safety ($4.7 million in 2012); the Brady Campaign ($2.7 million in 2012); the Brady Center ($3.1 million in 2010); Coalition to Stop Gun Violence ($308,761 in 2011); Sandy Hook Promise ($2.2 million in 2013); and the Violence Policy Center ($750,311 in 2012). [133]
The Current Gun Control Debate
Largely, the current public gun control debate in the United States occurs after a major mass shooting. There were at least 126 mass shootings between Jan. 2000 and July 2014. [139] [140] Proponents of more gun control often want more laws to try to prevent the mass shootings and call for smart gun laws, background checks, and more protections against the mentally ill buying guns. Opponents of more gun laws accuse proponents of using a tragedy to further a lost cause, stating that more laws would not have prevented the shootings. A Dec. 10, 2014 Pew Research Center survey found 52% of Americans believe the right to own guns should be protected while 46% believe gun ownership should be controlled, a switch from 1993 when 34% wanted gun rights protected and 57% wanted gun ownership controlled. [141] According to a Feb. 20, 2018 Quinnipiac Poll taken shortly after the Feb. 14 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, 66% of American voters support stricter gun control laws. [155]
On Dec. 18, 2018, the US Justice Department announced a new rule banning bump stocks, a gun attachment that allows a semi-automatic gun to fire rapidly like an automatic weapon. The new rule will classify bump stocks as machine guns, which will ban them nationwide under existing gun control laws. [161]

GUN CONTROL
Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?
The United States has 120.5 guns per 100 people, or about 393,347,000 guns, which is the highest total and per capita number in the world. 22% of Americans own one or more guns (35% of men and 12% of women). America's pervasive gun culture stems in part from its colonial history, revolutionary roots, frontier expansion, and the Second Amendment, which states: "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
Proponents of more gun control laws state that the Second Amendment was intended for militias; that gun violence would be reduced; that gun restrictions have always existed; and that a majority of Americans, including gun owners, support new gun restrictions.
Opponents say that the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to own guns; that guns are needed for self-defense from threats ranging from local criminals to foreign invaders; and that gun ownership deters crime rather than causes more crime. Read more background...
Top Pro & Con Arguments
The Second Amendment is not an unlimited right to own guns. Gun control laws are just as old or older than the Second Amendment (ratified in 1791). Some examples of gun control throughout colonial America included criminalizing the transfer of guns to Catholics, slaves, indentured servants, and Native Americans; regulating the storage of gun powder in homes; banning loaded guns in Boston houses; and mandating participation in formal gathering of troops and door-to-door surveys about guns owned. [1] [2] In the June 26, 2008 District of Columbia et al. v. Heller US Supreme Court majority opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia, LLB, wrote, "Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited… nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms." [3] On June 9, 2016 the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 7-4 that "[t]he right of the general public to carry a concealed firearm in public is not, and never has been, protected by the Second Amendment," thus upholding a law requiring a permitting process and "good cause" for concealed carry licenses in California. [145] [146] A 2018 study found that 91% of the 1,153 court cases with claims stating a government action or law violates the Second Amendment between the 2008 DC v. Heller decision and Feb. 1, 2016 failed. [157]
More gun control laws would reduce gun deaths. There were 464,033 total gun deaths between 1999 and 2013: 270,237 suicides (58.2% of total deaths); 174,773 homicides (37.7%); and 9,983 unintentional deaths (2.2%). [4] Guns were the leading cause of death by homicide (66.6% of all homicides) and by suicide (52.2% of all suicides). [4] David Frum, Daily Beast and CNN contributor, stated, "American children under age 15 were nine times more likely to die of a gun accident than children in other advanced wealthy countries… About 200 Americans go to emergency rooms every day with gunshot wounds." [5] A study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that "legal purchase of a handgun appears to be associated with a long-lasting increased risk of violent death" [6] According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, implementing federal universal background checks could reduce firearm deaths by a projected 56.9%; background checks for ammunition purchases could reduce deaths by a projected 80.7%; and gun identification requirements could reduce deaths by a projected 82.5%. [148] Gun licensing laws were associated with a 14% decrease in firearm homicides, while increases in firearm homicides were seen in places with right-to-carry and stand-your ground-laws.[158] [160]
High-capacity magazines should be banned because they too often turn murder into mass murder. A Mother Jones investigation found that high-capacity magazines were used in at least 50% of the 62 mass shootings between 1982 and 2012. [7] When high-capacity magazines were used in mass shootings, the death rate rose 63% and the injury rate rose 156%. [8] David H. Chipman, Senior Vice President of Public Safety for ShotSpotter and former Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) agent, stated that a high-capacity magazine "turns a killer into a killing machine." [7] Some gang members use high-capacity magazines, such as 30 rounds or even 90 rounds, to compensate for lack of accuracy and maximize the chance to harm. [9]
More gun control laws are needed to protect women from domestic abusers and stalkers. Five women are murdered with guns every day in the United States. [10] A woman's risk of being murdered increases 500% if a gun is present during a domestic dispute. [11] During the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, 5,364 US soldiers were killed in action between Oct. 7, 2001 and Jan. 28, 2015; between 2001 and 2012 6,410 women were killed with a gun by an intimate partner in the United States. [10] [12] A 2003 study of 23 populous high-income countries found that 86% of women killed by firearms were in the United States and American women are 11.4 times more likely to be the victims of gun homicides [13] 57% of mass shootings involved domestic violence. [11] [14] For example, the 2011 mass shooting at a Seal Beach, CA hair salon reportedly began because of the shooter's custody battle with his ex-wife who was a hair stylist at the salon. [11] [8] 31 states do not ban convicted misdemeanor stalkers from owning guns and 41 states do not force convicted domestic abusers from relinquishing guns they already own. [10] [14] 76% of women murdered and 85% of women who survived a murder attempt by an intimate partner were stalked in the year before the murder or murder attempt. [15]
Guns are rarely used in self-defense. Of the 29,618,300 violent crimes committed between 2007 and 2011, 0.79% of victims (235,700) protected themselves with a threat of use or use of a firearm, the least-employed protective behavior. [16] In 2010 there were 230 "justifiable homicides" in which a private citizen used a firearm to kill a felon, compared to 8,275 criminal gun homicides (or, 36 criminal homicides for every "justifiable homicide"). [17] Of the 84,495,500 property crimes committed between 2007 and 2011, 0.12% of victims (103,000) protected themselves with a threat of use or use of a firearm. [16]
Legally owned guns are frequently stolen and used by criminals. A June 2013 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report states that "[a]lmost all guns used in criminal acts enter circulation via initial legal transaction." [18] Between 2005 and 2010, 1.4 million guns were stolen from US homes during property crimes (including burglary and car theft), a yearly average of 232,400. [19] Ian Ayres, JD, PhD, and John J. Donohue, JD, PhD, Professors of Law at Yale Law School and Stanford Law School respectively, state, "with guns being a product that can be easily carried away and quickly sold at a relatively high fraction of the initial cost, the presence of more guns can actually serve as a stimulus to burglary and theft. Even if the gun owner had a permit to carry a concealed weapon and would never use it in furtherance of a crime, is it likely that the same can be said for the burglar who steals the gun?" [20]
Gun control laws would reduce the societal costs associated with gun violence. According to the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation (PIRE), in 2010, gun violence cost each person in the United States roughly $564 and the US government $5.5 billion in lost tax revenue; $4.7 billion in court costs; $1.4 billion in Medicare and Medicaid costs; $180 million in mental health care for victims; $224 million in insurance claims processing; and $133 million for law enforcement and medic response to shooting injuries. [21] [22] In 2010, there were 36,341 emergency room visits and 25,024 hospitalizations for gun injuries, costing an estimated $6.3 million. [23] 84% of those injured by firearms are uninsured, leaving taxpayers responsible for most of those bills through programs like Medicaid. [23] [24] [25] [26] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the costs of gun violence can include legal services, medical costs, perpetrator control, policing, incarceration, foster care, private security, lost earnings and time, life insurance, productivity, tourism, and psychological costs (pain and suffering), among others. [25] Homicide rates doubling has been associated with a 12.5% decline in property values. [25]
A majority of adults, including gun owners, support common sense gun control such as background checks, bans on assault weapons, and bans on high-capacity magazines. According to a Feb. 20, 2018 Quinnipiac Poll, 97% of American voters and 97% of gun owners support universal background checks. 67% support a nationwide ban on assault weapons, and 83% support mandatory waiting periods for gun purchases. [155] As much as 40% of all gun sales are undocumented private party gun sales that do not require a background check (aka the "gun show loophole"). [28] 56% of all adults surveyed approve of assault weapon bans and 53% of all adults surveyed approve of high-capacity magazine bans. [27] 89% of adults with a gun in the home approve of laws to prevent the purchase of guns by the mentally ill, and 82% approve of banning gun sales to people on no-fly lists. [27] Don Macalady, member of Hunters against Gun Violence, stated, "As a hunter and someone who has owned guns since I was a young boy, I believe that commonsense gun legislation makes us all safer. Background checks prevent criminals and other dangerous people from getting guns." [29]
More gun control leads to fewer suicides. Between 1999 and 2013 there were 270,237 firearm suicides in the United States, accounting for about 52% of all suicides during those years. [4] According to a Mar. 2014 study, when gun ownership went down in the United States, overall suicide rates went down. [30] [31] Firearm-related suicides accounted for 61% of the gun deaths in the United States between 2000 and 2010. [18] A Dec. 2009 study found "general barrier to firearm access created through state regulation can have a significant deterrent effect on male suicide rates in the United States. Permit requirements and bans on sales to minors were the most effective of the regulations analyzed." [32] In Indiana and Connecticut, after "red flag" laws to remove guns from people who may pose a threat were enacted, gun suicides decreased by 7.5% and 13.7% respectively, while suicides by other means did not decrease during the same time. [158] [159] A person who wants to kill him/herself is unlikely to commit suicide with poison or a knife when a gun is unavailable. [33]
Enacting gun control laws such as mandatory safety features would reduce the number of accidental gun deaths. Approximately 50% of unintentional fatal shootings were self-inflicted; and most unintentional firearm deaths were caused by friends or family members. [18] [4] According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the National Physicians Alliance, states with the highest concentration of guns have nine times the amount of accidental gun deaths and "89% of unintentional shooting deaths of children occur in the home—and most of these deaths occur when children are playing with a loaded gun in their parents’ absence." [34] The US General Accountability Office (GAO) estimated that 31% of total accidental shooting deaths could have been prevented by installing safety devices on guns: 100% of deaths per year in which a child under 6 years old shoots and kills him/herself or another child could be prevented by automatic child-proof safety locks; and 23% of accidental shooting deaths by adolescents and adults per year could be prevented by loading indicators showing when a bullet was in the chamber ready to be fired. [35] Marjorie Sanfilippo, PhD, Professor of Psychology at Eckerd College who has researched children’s behavior around guns, stated, "We put gates around swimming pools to keep children from drowning. We put safety caps on medications to keep children from poisoning themselves… [B]ecause children are naturally curious and impulsive, and because we have shown time and again that we cannot 'gun-proof' them with education, we have a responsibility to keep guns out of the hands of children." [36]
The presence of a gun makes a conflict more likely to become violent. The FBI found that in 2013 arguments (such as romantic triangles, brawls fueled by alcohol or drugs, and arguments over money) resulted in 1,962 gun deaths (59.9% of the total). [37] A June 1985 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that "the weapons used [in altercations]… were those closest at hand." [38] An editorial published in the June 1985 American Journal of Public Health noted, "gun-inflicted deaths [often] ensue from impromptu arguments and fights; in the US, two-thirds of the 7,900 deaths in 1981 involving arguments and brawls were caused by guns." [39] A 1993 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that "[r]ather than confer protection, guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance." [40]
Armed civilians are unlikely to stop crimes and are more likely to make dangerous situations, including mass shootings, more deadly. None of the 62 mass shootings between 1982 and 2012 was stopped by an armed civilian. [41] Gun rights activists regularly state that a 2002 mass shooting at the Appalachian School of Law in Virginia was stopped by armed students, but those students were current and former law enforcement officers and the killer was out of bullets when subdued. [41] Other mass shootings often held up as examples of armed citizens being able to stop mass shootings involved law enforcement or military personnel and/or the shooter had stopped shooting before being subdued, such as a 1997 high school shooting in Pearl, MS; a 1998 middle school dance shooting in Edinboro, PA; a 2007 church shooting in Colorado Springs, CO; and a 2008 bar shooting in Winnemucca, NV. [42] Jeffrey Voccola, Assistant Professor of Writing at Kutztown University, notes, "The average gun owner, no matter how responsible, is not trained in law enforcement or on how to handle life-threatening situations, so in most cases, if a threat occurs, increasing the number of guns only creates a more volatile and dangerous situation." [43]
Countries with restrictive gun control laws have lower gun homicide and suicide rates than the United States. Both Switzerland and Finland require gun owners to acquire licenses and pass background checks that include mental and criminal records, among other restrictions and requirements. [44] In 2007 Switzerland ranked number 3 in international gun ownership rates with 45.7 guns per 100 people (about 3,400,000 guns total). [45] In 2009 Switzerland had 24 gun homicides (0.31 deaths per 100,000 people) and 253 gun suicides (3.29 deaths per 100,000 people). [44] Finland ranked fourth in international gun ownership rates with 45.3 guns per 100 people (about 2,400,000 guns total). [45] In 2007 Finland had 23 (0.43 deaths per 100,000 people) gun homicides and 172 gun suicides (4.19 deaths per 100,000 people). [44] The United States, categorized as having "permissive" firearm regulation by GunPolicy.org, ranked first in international gun ownership rates with 88.8 guns per 100 people (about 270,000,000 guns total). [44] [45] In 2007 the United States had 12,632 gun homicides (4.19 deaths per 100,000 people) and 17,352 gun suicides (5.76 deaths per 100,000 people). [44] [4] Harvard professor David Hemenway, PhD, wrote "We analyzed the relationship between homicide and gun availability using data from 26 developed countries from the early 1990s. We found that across developed countries, where guns are more available, there are more homicides." [46] According to a Mar. 2016 study, gun homicide rates in the United States were 25.3 times higher and gun suicides were 8 times higher in 2010 than in other populous, high-income countries. Additionally, 90% of women, 91% of 0- to 14-year olds, 92% of 15- to 24-year-olds, and 82% of all people killed by firearms were from the United States. [147]
The Second Amendment was intended to protect the right of militias to own guns, not the right of individuals. Former Justice John Paul Stevens, JD, in his dissenting opinion for District of Columbia et al. v. Heller, wrote, "the Framer's single-minded focus in crafting the constitutional guarantee 'to keep and bear arms' was on military use of firearms, which they viewed in the context of service in state militias," hence the inclusion of the phrase "well regulated militia." [3] Michael Waldman, JD, President of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, stated there is nothing about an individual right to bear arms in the notes about the Second Amendment when it was being drafted, discussed, or ratified; the US Supreme Court declined to rule in favor of the individual right four times between 1876 and 1939; and all law articles on the Second Amendment from 1888 to 1959 stated that an individual right was not guaranteed. [47]
Civilians, including hunters, should not own military-grade firearms or firearm accessories. President Ronald Reagan and others did not think the AR-15 military rifle (also called M16s by the Air Force) should be owned by civilians and, when the AR-15 was included in the assault weapons ban of 1994 (which expired on Sep. 13, 2004), the NRA supported the legislation. [48] The Second Amendment was written at a time when the most common arms were long rifles that had to be reloaded after every shot. Civilians today have access to folding, detaching, or telescoping stocks that make the guns more easily concealed and carried; silencers to muffle gunshot sounds; flash suppressors to fire in low-light conditions without being blinded by the flash and to conceal the shooter’s location; or grenade launcher attachments. [49] Jonathan Lowy, Director of Legal Action Project at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, stated, "These are weapons that will shred your venison before you eat it, or go through the walls of your apartment when you’re trying to defend yourself… [they are] made for mass killing, but not useful for law-abiding citizens." [50]
The Second Amendment of the US Constitution protects individual gun ownership. The Second Amendment of the US Constitution reads, "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed." Gun ownership is an American tradition older than the country itself and is protected by the Second Amendment; more gun control laws would infringe upon the right to bear arms. Justice Antonin Scalia, LLB, in the June 26, 2008 District of Columbia et al. v. Heller US Supreme Court majority opinion syllabus stated, "The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home." [3] The McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010) ruling also stated that the Second Amendment is an individual right. [51] Lawrence Hunter, Chairman of Revolution PAC, stated, "The Founders understood that the right to own and bear laws is as fundamental and as essential to maintaining liberty as are the rights of free speech, a free press, freedom of religion and the other protections against government encroachments on liberty delineated in the Bill of Rights." [52]
Gun control laws do not deter crime; gun ownership deters crime. A Nov. 26, 2013 study found that, between 1980 and 2009, "assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level" and "states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders." [103] While gun ownership doubled in the twentieth century, the murder rate decreased. [53] John R. Lott, Jr., PhD, author of More Guns, Less Crime: Understanding Crime and Gun Control Laws, stated, "States with the largest increases in gun ownership also have the largest drops in violent crimes... The effect on 'shall-issue' [concealed gun] laws on these crimes [where two or more people were killed] has been dramatic. When states passed these laws, the number of multiple-victim shootings declined by 84 percent. Deaths from these shootings plummeted on average by 90 percent and injuries by 82 percent." [54] A Dec. 10, 2014 Pew survey found that 57% of people believe that owning a gun protects them from being victimized. [55] Journalist John Stossel explained, "Criminals don't obey the law… Without the fear of retaliation from victims who might be packing heat, criminals in possession of these [illegal] weapons now have a much easier job... As the saying goes, 'If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.'" [56]
Gun control laws infringe upon the right to self-defense and deny people a sense of safety. According to the National Rifle Association (NRA), guns are used for self-defense 2.5 million times a year. [57] The police cannot protect everyone all of the time. 61% of men and 56% of women surveyed by Pew Research said that stricter gun laws would "make it more difficult for people to protect their homes and families." [58] Nelson Lund, JD, PhD, Professor at George Mason University School of Law, stated, "The right to self-defense and to the means of defending oneself is a basic natural right that grows out of the right to life" and "many [gun control laws] interfere with the ability of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves against violent criminals." [59] Constitutions in 37 US states protect the right to bear arms for self-defense, most with explicit language such as Alabama's: "every citizen has a right to bear arms in defense of himself and the state." [60] [61] Wayne LaPierre, Executive Vice President of the NRA, stated, "The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." [62] A May 9, 2013 48% of convicted felons surveyed admitted that they avoided committing crimes when they knew the victim was armed with a gun. [63] Pew Foundation report found that 79% of male gun owners and 80% of female gun owners said owning a gun made them feel safer and 64% of people living in a home in which someone else owns a gun felt safer. [58] Even Senator Dianne Feinstein, a gun control advocate, carried a concealed gun when her life was threatened and her home attacked by the New World Liberation Front in the 1970s. [64]
Gun control laws, especially those that try to ban "assault weapons," infringe upon the right to own guns for hunting and sport. In 2011, there were 13.7 million hunters 16 years old or older in the United States, and they spent $7.7 billion on guns, sights, ammunition, and other hunting equipment. [65] [66] High-powered semiautomatic rifles and shotguns are used to hunt and in target shooting tournaments each year. [67] According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, "So-called 'Assault weapons' are more often than not less powerful than other hunting rifles. The term 'assault weapon' was conjured up by anti-gun legislators to scare voters into thinking these firearms are something out of a horror movie… [T]he Colt AR-15 and Springfield M1A, both labeled 'assault weapons,' are the rifles most used for marksmanship competitions in the United States. And their cartridges are standard hunting calibers, useful for game up to and including deer." [68] According to a Feb. 2013 Pew Research report, 32% of gun owners owned guns for hunting and 7% owned guns for target or sport shooting. [58]
Gun control laws will not prevent criminals from obtaining guns or breaking laws. Of 62 mass shootings in the United States between 1982 and 2012, 49 of the shooters used legally obtained guns. Collectively, 143 guns were possessed by the killers with about 75% obtained legally. [69] John R. Lott, Jr., PhD, gun rights activist, stated, "The problem with such [gun control] laws is that they take away guns from law-abiding citizens, while would-be criminals ignore them." [70] According to a Bureau of Justice Statistics May 2013 report, 37.4% of state prison inmates who "used, carried, or possessed a firearm when they committed the crime for which they were serving a prison sentence" obtained the gun from a family member or friend. [16] Despite Chicago's ban on gun shops, shooting ranges, assault weapons, and high capacity magazines, in 2014 Chicago had 2,089 shooting victims including at least 390 murders. [71] [72] [73] Approximately 50,000 guns were recovered by police in Chicago between 2001 and Mar. 2012. The guns came from all 50 states, and more than half came from outside of Illinois. [74]
Gun control laws give too much power to the government and may result in government tyranny and the government taking away all guns from citizens. 57% of people surveyed by Pew Research in Feb. 2013 said that gun control laws would "give too much power to the government over the people." [58] The NRA's Wayne LaPierre stated, "if you look at why our Founding Fathers put it [the Second Amendment] there, they had lived under the tyranny of King George and they wanted to make sure that these free people in this new country would never be subjugated again and have to live under tyranny." [75] Alex Jones, radio host, in a Jan 7, 2013 interview with Piers Morgan, stated, "The Second Amendment isn't there for duck hunting, it's there to protect us from tyrannical government and street thugs… 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!" [76]
Gun control laws such as background checks and micro-stamping are an invasion of privacy. Background checks would require government databases that keep personal individual information on gun owners, including name, addresses, mental health history, criminal records, and more. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) worried that Senator Harry Reid's 2013 proposed background check legislation (the bill failed 54-46) would have allowed the government to keep databases of gun purchases indefinitely, creating a "worry that you're going to see searches of the databases and an expansion for purposes that were not intended when the information was collected." [77] [78] Micro-stamping similarly requires a database of gun owners and the codes their personal guns would stamp on cartridge cases. [79] Senators Rand Paul (R-KY), Mike Lee (R-UT), and Ted Cruz (R-TX) wrote that they would oppose any legislation that infringes "on the American people's constitutional right to bear arms, or on their ability to exercise this right without being subjected to government surveillance." [80]
More gun control is unnecessary because relatively few people are killed by guns. According to the CDC's "Leading Causes of Death Reports," between 1999 and 2013, Americans were 21.5 times more likely to die of heart disease (9,691,733 deaths); 18.7 times more likely to die of malignant tumors (8,458,868 deaths); and 2.4 times more likely to die of diabetes or 2.3 times more likely to die of Alzheimer's (1,080,298 and 1,053,207 respectively) than to die from a firearm (whether by accident, homicide, or suicide). [4] The flu and related pneumonia (875,143 deaths); traffic accidents (594,280 deaths); and poisoning whether via accident, homicide, or suicide (475,907 deaths) all killed more people between 1999 and 2013 than firearms. [4] Firearms were the 12th leading cause of deaths for all deaths between 1999 and 2013, responsible for 1.3% of deaths with 464,033 deaths. [4] Internationally, the claim that the United States has a major problem with firearm homicide is exaggerated. The United States is ranked 28 in international homicide rates with 2.97 gun murders per 100,000 people in 2012. [89]
Gun control laws and lower gun ownership rates do not prevent suicides. Lithuania has one of the world's lowest gun ownership rates (0.7 guns per 100 people) but its suicide rate (by any method) was 45.06 per 100,000 people in 1999, the highest suicide rate among 71 countries with available information. [44] Japan has a low gun ownership rate at 0.6 guns per 100 people and a high suicide rate of 18.41 suicides per 100,000 people in 1997 (ranking it 11 out of 71 countries). [44] [45] South Korea has a low gun ownership rate (1.1 guns per 100 people) but has a high rate of suicide and the highest rate of gun suicides (12.63 per 100,000 people in 1997). [44] [45] By contrast the United States has the 26th highest suicide rate (12.3 suicides per 100,000 people in 2011) and the highest gun ownership rate (88.8 guns per 100 people). [44] [45] Jim Barrett, author for TheTruthAboutGuns.com, stated, "the theory that the restriction or elimination of guns would have a positive effect on the overall suicide rate in the U.S. does not hold up under scrutiny." [81]
More gun control is not needed; education about guns and gun safety is needed to prevent accidental gun deaths. 95% of all US gun owners believe that children should learn about gun safety. [154] Guns don't kill people; people kill people. And people need more gun education and mental illness screening to prevent massacres.The Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute, Inc (SAAMI), stated, "Whether in the field, at the range or in the home, a responsible and knowledgeable gun owner is rarely involved in a firearms accident of any kind." [82] Heidi Cifelli, Former Program Manager of the NRA's Eddie Eagle GunSafe Program, stated, "Gun education is the best way to save young lives." [83] The NRA states that the Eddie Eagle program is not meant to "teach whether guns are good or bad, but rather to promote the protection and safety of children… Like swimming pools, electrical outlets, matchbooks, and household poison, they're [guns] treated simply as a fact of everyday life." [84] According to Kyle Wintersteen, Managing Editor of Guns and Ammo, studies show that "children taught about firearms and their legitimate uses by family members have much lower rates of delinquency than children in households without guns" and "children introduced to guns associate them with freedom, security, and recreation—not violence." [85]
Gun control laws would prevent citizens from protecting themselves from foreign invaders. The Libertarian Party stated, "A responsible, well-armed and trained citizenry is the best protection against domestic crime and the threat of foreign invasion." [86] Counsel for the NRA stated, "It is evident that the framers of the Constitution did not intend to limit the right to keep and bear arms to a formal military body or organized militia, but intended to provide for an 'unorganized' armed citizenry prepared to assist in the common defense against a foreign invader or a domestic tyrant." [87] Marco Rubio (R-FL), US Senator, speaking about gun control laws during his 2016 presidential campaign, stated, "If God forbid, ISIS visits our life, our neighborhood, our school, any part of us, the last thing standing, the last line of defense could very well be our ability to protect ourselves." [149]
Strict gun control laws do not work in Mexico, and will not work in the United States. Mexico has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world and yet, in 2012, Mexico had 11,309 gun murders (9.97 gun homicides per 100,000 people) compared to the United States that had 9,146 gun homicides (2.97 per 100,000 people). [88] [89]. The country has only one legal gun store (the Directorate of Arms and Munitions Sales), compared to at least 63,709 legal gun stores and pawn shops in the United States as of Feb. 10, 2014. [90] [91] Mexico's gun store is on a secure military base and customers must present a valid ID, go through a metal detector, and turn over cellphones and cameras to guards. To actually buy a gun, customers have to show proof of honest income, provide references, pass a criminal background check, prove any military duties were completed with honor, and be fingerprinted and photographed. If allowed to purchase a gun, the customer may buy only one gun (choosing from only .38 caliber pistols or lower) and one box of bullets. [90] [92] [93] Between 2006 and 2010, Mexico's one gun shop sold 6,490 guns, [92] yet as of 2012, Mexicans own about 15,000,000 guns, or about 13.5 guns per 100 people. [44]
Gun control laws are racist. Current gun control laws are frequently aimed at inner city, poor, black communities who are perceived as more dangerous than white gun owners. [94] [95] Charles Gallagher, MA, PhD, the Chair of Sociology at LaSalle University, stated that some gun control laws are still founded on racial fears: "Whites walking down Main Street with an AK-47 are defenders of American values; a black man doing the same thing is Public Enemy No. 1." [96] In the late 1960s, gun control laws were enacted in reaction to the militant, gun-carrying Black Panthers. [97] Adam Winkler, MA, JD, UCLA Constitutional Law Professor, stated "The KKK began as a gun-control organization. Before the Civil War, blacks were never allowed to own guns" so, after the Civil War, there was "constant pressure among white racists to keep guns out of the hands of African Americans because they would rise up and revolt.” [97] In Virginia, in response to Nat Turner's Rebellion (also called the Southampton Rebellion, in which slaves killed 55 to 65 people in the most fatal slave uprising in the United States) in 1831, a law was passed that prohibited free black people "to keep or carry any firelock of any kind, any military weapon, or any powder or lead and all laws allowing free black people to possess firearms were repealed. [98].
The Second Amendment was intended to protect gun ownership of all able-bodied men so that they could participate in the militia to keep the peace and defend the country if needed. According to the United States Code, a "militia" is composed of all "able-bodied males at least 17 years of age… under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard." [99] Therefore, the militia mentioned in the Second Amendment would have been composed of almost all adult men and, in turn, that most adult men should not have their right to own firearms infringed. [100] A 1792 federal law required that every man eligible for militia service own a gun and ammunition suitable for military service, report for frequent inspection of their guns, and register their gun ownership on public records. [101] Daniel J. Schultz, lawyer, stated, "the Framers [of the Constitution and Bill of Rights] understood that 'well-regulated' militias, that is, armed citizens, ready to form militias that would be well trained, self-regulated and disciplined would post no threat to their fellow citizens, but would, indeed, help to 'insure domestic Tranquility' and 'provide for the common defence.'" [100]
Gun control efforts have proved ineffective. According to David Lampo, Publications Director of the Cato Institute, "there is no correlation between waiting periods and murder or robbery rates." [102] Banning high-capacity magazines will not necessarily deter crime because even small gun magazines can be changed in seconds.The "gun show loophole" is virtually nonexistent because commercial dealers, who sell the majority of guns at shows and elsewhere, are bound by strict federal laws. [102] According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates, and, of 25 state laws, nine were associated with higher gun death rates. [148]

The Second Amendment is not an unlimited right to own guns.
Gun control laws are just as old or older than the Second Amendment (ratified in 1791). Some examples of gun control throughout colonial America included criminalizing the transfer of guns to Catholics, slaves, indentured servants, and Native Americans; regulating the storage of gun powder in homes; banning loaded guns in Boston houses; and mandating participation in formal gathering of troops and door-to-door surveys about guns owned. [1] [2] In the June 26, 2008 District of Columbia et al. v. Heller US Supreme Court majority opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia, LLB, wrote, "Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited… nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms." [3] On June 9, 2016 the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 7-4 that "[t]he right of the general public to carry a concealed firearm in public is not, and never has been, protected by the Second Amendment," thus upholding a law requiring a permitting process and "good cause" for concealed carry licenses in California. [145] [146] A 2018 study found that 91% of the 1,153 court cases with claims stating a government action or law violates the Second Amendment between the 2008 DC v. Heller decision and Feb. 1, 2016 failed. [157]

There were 464,033 total gun deaths between 1999 and 2013: 270,237 suicides (58.2% of total deaths); 174,773 homicides (37.7%); and 9,983 unintentional deaths (2.2%). [4] Guns were the leading cause of death by homicide (66.6% of all homicides) and by suicide (52.2% of all suicides). [4] David Frum, Daily Beast and CNN contributor, stated, "American children under age 15 were nine times more likely to die of a gun accident than children in other advanced wealthy countries… About 200 Americans go to emergency rooms every day with gunshot wounds." [5] A study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that "legal purchase of a handgun appears to be associated with a long-lasting increased risk of violent death" [6] According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, implementing federal universal background checks could reduce firearm deaths by a projected 56.9%; background checks for ammunition purchases could reduce deaths by a projected 80.7%; and gun identification requirements could reduce deaths by a projected 82.5%. [148] Gun licensing laws were associated with a 14% decrease in firearm homicides, while increases in firearm homicides were seen in places with right-to-carry and stand-your ground-laws. [148] [160]

High-capacity magazines should be banned because they too often turn murder into mass murder.
A Mother Jones investigation found that high-capacity magazines were used in at least 50% of the 62 mass shootings between 1982 and 2012. [7] When high-capacity magazines were used in mass shootings, the death rate rose 63% and the injury rate rose 156%. [8] David H. Chipman, Senior Vice President of Public Safety for ShotSpotter and former Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) agent, stated that a high-capacity magazine "turns a killer into a killing machine." [7] Some gang members use high-capacity magazines, such as 30 rounds or even 90 rounds, to compensate for lack of accuracy and maximize the chance to harm. [9]

More gun control laws are needed to protect women from domestic abusers and stalkers.
Five women are murdered with guns every day in the United States. [10] A woman's risk of being murdered increases 500% if a gun is present during a domestic dispute. [11] During the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, 5,364 US soldiers were killed in action between Oct. 7, 2001 and Jan. 28, 2015; between 2001 and 2012 6,410 women were killed with a gun by an intimate partner in the United States. [10] [12] A 2003 study of 23 populous high-income countries found that 86% of women killed by firearms were in the United States and American women are 11.4 times more likely to be the victims of gun homicides [13] 57% of mass shootings involved domestic violence. [11] [14] For example, the 2011 mass shooting at a Seal Beach, CA hair salon reportedly began because of the shooter's custody battle with his ex-wife who was a hair stylist at the salon. [11] [8] 31 states do not ban convicted misdemeanor stalkers from owning guns and 41 states do not force convicted domestic abusers from relinquishing guns they already own. [10] [14] 76% of women murdered and 85% of women who survived a murder attempt by an intimate partner were stalked in the year before the murder or murder attempt. [15]

A June 2013 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report states that "[a]lmost all guns used in criminal acts enter circulation via initial legal transaction." [18] Between 2005 and 2010, 1.4 million guns were stolen from US homes during property crimes (including burglary and car theft), a yearly average of 232,400. [19] Ian Ayres, JD, PhD, and John J. Donohue, JD, PhD, Professors of Law at Yale Law School and Stanford Law School respectively, state, "with guns being a product that can be easily carried away and quickly sold at a relatively high fraction of the initial cost, the presence of more guns can actually serve as a stimulus to burglary and theft. Even if the gun owner had a permit to carry a concealed weapon and would never use it in furtherance of a crime, is it likely that the same can be said for the burglar who steals the gun?" [20]

Gun control laws would reduce the societal costs associated with gun violence.
According to the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation (PIRE), in 2010, gun violence cost each person in the United States roughly $564 and the US government $5.5 billion in lost tax revenue; $4.7 billion in court costs; $1.4 billion in Medicare and Medicaid costs; $180 million in mental health care for victims; $224 million in insurance claims processing; and $133 million for law enforcement and medic response to shooting injuries. [21] [22] In 2010, there were 36,341 emergency room visits and 25,024 hospitalizations for gun injuries, costing an estimated $6.3 million. [23] 84% of those injured by firearms are uninsured, leaving taxpayers responsible for most of those bills through programs like Medicaid. [23] [24] [25] [26] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the costs of gun violence can include legal services, medical costs, perpetrator control, policing, incarceration, foster care, private security, lost earnings and time, life insurance, productivity, tourism, and psychological costs (pain and suffering), among others. [25] Homicide rates doubling has been associated with a 12.5% decline in property values. [25]

A majority of adults, including gun owners, support common sense gun control such as background checks, bans on assault weapons, and bans on high-capacity magazines.
According to a Feb. 20, 2018 Quinnipiac Poll, 97% of American voters and 97% of gun owners support universal background checks. 67% support a nationwide ban on assault weapons, and 83% support mandatory waiting periods for gun purchases. [155] As much as 40% of all gun sales are undocumented private party gun sales that do not require a background check (aka the "gun show loophole"). [28] 56% of all adults surveyed approve of assault weapon bans and 53% of all adults surveyed approve of high-capacity magazine bans. [27] 89% of adults with a gun in the home approve of laws to prevent the purchase of guns by the mentally ill, and 82% approve of banning gun sales to people on no-fly lists. [27]Don Macalady, member of Hunters against Gun Violence, stated, "As a hunter and someone who has owned guns since I was a young boy, I believe that commonsense gun legislation makes us all safer. Background checks prevent criminals and other dangerous people from getting guns." [29]

More gun control leads to fewer suicides.
Between 1999 and 2013 there were 270,237 firearm suicides in the United States, accounting for about 52% of all suicides during those years. [4] According to a Mar. 2014 study, when gun ownership went down in the United States, overall suicide rates went down. [30] [31] Firearm-related suicides accounted for 61% of the gun deaths in the United States between 2000 and 2010. [18] A Dec. 2009 study found "general barrier to firearm access created through state regulation can have a significant deterrent effect on male suicide rates in the United States. Permit requirements and bans on sales to minors were the most effective of the regulations analyzed." [32] In Indiana and Connecticut, after "red flag" laws to remove guns from people who may pose a threat were enacted, gun suicides decreased by 7.5% and 13.7% respectively, while suicides by other means did not decrease during the same time. [158] [159] A person who wants to kill him/herself is unlikely to commit suicide with poison or a knife when a gun is unavailable. [33]

Enacting gun control laws such as mandatory safety features would reduce the number of accidental gun deaths.
Approximately 50% of unintentional fatal shootings were self-inflicted; and most unintentional firearm deaths were caused by friends or family members. [18] [4] According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the National Physicians Alliance, states with the highest concentration of guns have nine times the amount of accidental gun deaths and "89% of unintentional shooting deaths of children occur in the home—and most of these deaths occur when children are playing with a loaded gun in their parents’ absence." [34] The US General Accountability Office (GAO) estimated that 31% of total accidental shooting deaths could have been prevented by installing safety devices on guns: 100% of deaths per year in which a child under 6 years old shoots and kills him/herself or another child could be prevented by automatic child-proof safety locks; and 23% of accidental shooting deaths by adolescents and adults per year could be prevented by loading indicators showing when a bullet was in the chamber ready to be fired. [35] Marjorie Sanfilippo, PhD, Professor of Psychology at Eckerd College who has researched children’s behavior around guns, stated, "We put gates around swimming pools to keep children from drowning. We put safety caps on medications to keep children from poisoning themselves… [B]ecause children are naturally curious and impulsive, and because we have shown time and again that we cannot 'gun-proof' them with education, we have a responsibility to keep guns out of the hands of children."

The presence of a gun makes a conflict more likely to become violent.
The FBI found that in 2013 arguments (such as romantic triangles, brawls fueled by alcohol or drugs, and arguments over money) resulted in 1,962 gun deaths (59.9% of the total). [37] A June 1985 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that "the weapons used [in altercations]… were those closest at hand." [38] An editorial published in the June 1985 American Journal of Public Health noted, "gun-inflicted deaths [often] ensue from impromptu arguments and fights; in the US, two-thirds of the 7,900 deaths in 1981 involving arguments and brawls were caused by guns." [39] A 1993 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that "[r]ather than confer protection, guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance."

Armed civilians are unlikely to stop crimes and are more likely to make dangerous situations, including mass shootings, more deadly.
None of the 62 mass shootings between 1982 and 2012 was stopped by an armed civilian. [41] Gun rights activists regularly state that a 2002 mass shooting at the Appalachian School of Law in Virginia was stopped by armed students, but those students were current and former law enforcement officers and the killer was out of bullets when subdued. [41] Other mass shootings often held up as examples of armed citizens being able to stop mass shootings involved law enforcement or military personnel and/or the shooter had stopped shooting before being subdued, such as a 1997 high school shooting in Pearl, MS; a 1998 middle school dance shooting in Edinboro, PA; a 2007 church shooting in Colorado Springs, CO; and a 2008 bar shooting in Winnemucca, NV. [42] Jeffrey Voccola, Assistant Professor of Writing at Kutztown University, notes, "The average gun owner, no matter how responsible, is not trained in law enforcement or on how to handle life-threatening situations, so in most cases, if a threat occurs, increasing the number of guns only creates a more volatile and dangerous situation."

Countries with restrictive gun control laws have lower gun homicide and suicide rates than the United States.
Both Switzerland and Finland require gun owners to acquire licenses and pass background checks that include mental and criminal records, among other restrictions and requirements. [44] In 2007 Switzerland ranked number 3 in international gun ownership rates with 45.7 guns per 100 people (about 3,400,000 guns total). [45] In 2009 Switzerland had 24 gun homicides (0.31 deaths per 100,000 people) and 253 gun suicides (3.29 deaths per 100,000 people). [44] Finland ranked fourth in international gun ownership rates with 45.3 guns per 100 people (about 2,400,000 guns total). [45] In 2007 Finland had 23 (0.43 deaths per 100,000 people) gun homicides and 172 gun suicides (4.19 deaths per 100,000 people). [44] The United States, categorized as having "permissive" firearm regulation by GunPolicy.org, ranked first in international gun ownership rates with 88.8 guns per 100 people (about 270,000,000 guns total). [44] [45] In 2007 the United States had 12,632 gun homicides (4.19 deaths per 100,000 people) and 17,352 gun suicides (5.76 deaths per 100,000 people). [44] [4] Harvard professor David Hemenway, PhD, wrote "We analyzed the relationship between homicide and gun availability using data from 26 developed countries from the early 1990s. We found that across developed countries, where guns are more available, there are more homicides." [46] According to a Mar. 2016 study, gun homicide rates in the United States were 25.3 times higher and gun suicides were 8 times higher in 2010 than in other populous, high-income countries. Additionally, 90% of women, 91% of 0- to 14-year olds, 92% of 15- to 24-year-olds, and 82% of all people killed by firearms were from the United States. [147]

The Second Amendment was intended to protect the right of militias to own guns, not the right of individuals.
Former Justice John Paul Stevens, JD, in his dissenting opinion for District of Columbia et al. v. Heller, wrote, "the Framer's single-minded focus in crafting the constitutional guarantee 'to keep and bear arms' was on military use of firearms, which they viewed in the context of service in state militias," hence the inclusion of the phrase "well regulated militia." [3] Michael Waldman, JD, President of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, stated there is nothing about an individual right to bear arms in the notes about the Second Amendment when it was being drafted, discussed, or ratified; the US Supreme Court declined to rule in favor of the individual right four times between 1876 and 1939; and all law articles on the Second Amendment from 1888 to 1959 stated that an individual right was not guaranteed.

Civilians, including hunters, should not own military-grade firearms or firearm accessories.
President Ronald Reagan and others did not think the AR-15 military rifle (also called M16s by the Air Force) should be owned by civilians and, when the AR-15 was included in the assault weapons ban of 1994 (which expired on Sep. 13, 2004), the NRA supported the legislation. [48] The Second Amendment was written at a time when the most common arms were long rifles that had to be reloaded after every shot. Civilians today have access to folding, detaching, or telescoping stocks that make the guns more easily concealed and carried; silencers to muffle gunshot sounds; flash suppressors to fire in low-light conditions without being blinded by the flash and to conceal the shooter’s location; or grenade launcher attachments. [49] Jonathan Lowy, Director of Legal Action Project at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, stated, "These are weapons that will shred your venison before you eat it, or go through the walls of your apartment when you’re trying to defend yourself… [they are] made for mass killing, but not useful for law-abiding citizens."

The Second Amendment of the US Constitution protects individual gun ownership.
The Second Amendment of the US Constitution reads, "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed." Gun ownership is an American tradition older than the country itself and is protected by the Second Amendment; more gun control laws would infringe upon the right to bear arms. Justice Antonin Scalia, LLB, in the June 26, 2008 District of Columbia et al. v. Heller US Supreme Court majority opinion syllabus stated, "The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home." [3] The McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010) ruling also stated that the Second Amendment is an individual right. [51] Lawrence Hunter, Chairman of Revolution PAC, stated, "The Founders understood that the right to own and bear laws is as fundamental and as essential to maintaining liberty as are the rights of free speech, a free press, freedom of religion and the other protections against government encroachments on liberty delineated in the Bill of Rights."

Gun control laws do not deter crime; gun ownership deters crime.
A Nov. 26, 2013 study found that, between 1980 and 2009, "assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level" and "states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders." [103] While gun ownership doubled in the twentieth century, the murder rate decreased. [53] John R. Lott, Jr., PhD, author of More Guns, Less Crime: Understanding Crime and Gun Control Laws, stated, "States with the largest increases in gun ownership also have the largest drops in violent crimes... The effect on 'shall-issue' [concealed gun] laws on these crimes [where two or more people were killed] has been dramatic. When states passed these laws, the number of multiple-victim shootings declined by 84 percent. Deaths from these shootings plummeted on average by 90 percent and injuries by 82 percent." [54] A Dec. 10, 2014 Pew survey found that 57% of people believe that owning a gun protects them from being victimized. [55] Journalist John Stossel explained, "Criminals don't obey the law… Without the fear of retaliation from victims who might be packing heat, criminals in possession of these [illegal] weapons now have a much easier job... As the saying goes, 'If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.'" [56]

Gun control laws infringe upon the right to self-defense and deny people a sense of safety.
According to the National Rifle Association (NRA), guns are used for self-defense 2.5 million times a year. [57] The police cannot protect everyone all of the time. 61% of men and 56% of women surveyed by Pew Research said that stricter gun laws would "make it more difficult for people to protect their homes and families." [58] Nelson Lund, JD, PhD, Professor at George Mason University School of Law, stated, "The right to self-defense and to the means of defending oneself is a basic natural right that grows out of the right to life" and "many [gun control laws] interfere with the ability of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves against violent criminals." [59] Constitutions in 37 US states protect the right to bear arms for self-defense, most with explicit language such as Alabama's: "every citizen has a right to bear arms in defense of himself and the state." [60] [61] Wayne LaPierre, Executive Vice President of the NRA, stated, "The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." [62] A May 9, 2013 48% of convicted felons surveyed admitted that they avoided committing crimes when they knew the victim was armed with a gun. [63] Pew Foundation report found that 79% of male gun owners and 80% of female gun owners said owning a gun made them feel safer and 64% of people living in a home in which someone else owns a gun felt safer. [58] Even Senator Dianne Feinstein, a gun control advocate, carried a concealed gun when her life was threatened and her home attacked by the New World Liberation Front in the 1970s. [64]

In 2011, there were 13.7 million hunters 16 years old or older in the United States, and they spent $7.7 billion on guns, sights, ammunition, and other hunting equipment. [65] [66] High-powered semiautomatic rifles and shotguns are used to hunt and in target shooting tournaments each year. [67] According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, "So-called 'Assault weapons' are more often than not less powerful than other hunting rifles. The term 'assault weapon' was conjured up by anti-gun legislators to scare voters into thinking these firearms are something out of a horror movie… [T]he Colt AR-15 and Springfield M1A, both labeled 'assault weapons,' are the rifles most used for marksmanship competitions in the United States. And their cartridges are standard hunting calibers, useful for game up to and including deer." [68] According to a Feb. 2013 Pew Research report, 32% of gun owners owned guns for hunting and 7% owned guns for target or sport shooting. [58]

Of 62 mass shootings in the United States between 1982 and 2012, 49 of the shooters used legally obtained guns. Collectively, 143 guns were possessed by the killers with about 75% obtained legally. [69] John R. Lott, Jr., PhD, gun rights activist, stated, "The problem with such [gun control] laws is that they take away guns from law-abiding citizens, while would-be criminals ignore them." [70] According to a Bureau of Justice Statistics May 2013 report, 37.4% of state prison inmates who "used, carried, or possessed a firearm when they committed the crime for which they were serving a prison sentence" obtained the gun from a family member or friend. [16] Despite Chicago's ban on gun shops, shooting ranges, assault weapons, and high capacity magazines, in 2014 Chicago had 2,089 shooting victims including at least 390 murders. [71] [72] [73] Approximately 50,000 guns were recovered by police in Chicago between 2001 and Mar. 2012. The guns came from all 50 states, and more than half came from outside of Illinois. [74]

Gun control laws such as background checks and micro-stamping are an invasion of privacy.
Background checks would require government databases that keep personal individual information on gun owners, including name, addresses, mental health history, criminal records, and more. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) worried that Senator Harry Reid's 2013 proposed background check legislation (the bill failed 54-46) would have allowed the government to keep databases of gun purchases indefinitely, creating a "worry that you're going to see searches of the databases and an expansion for purposes that were not intended when the information was collected." [77] [78] Micro-stamping similarly requires a database of gun owners and the codes their personal guns would stamp on cartridge cases. [79] Senators Rand Paul (R-KY), Mike Lee (R-UT), and Ted Cruz (R-TX) wrote that they would oppose any legislation that infringes "on the American people's constitutional right to bear arms, or on their ability to exercise this right without being subjected to government surveillance."

[84] According to Kyle Wintersteen, Managing Editor of Guns and Ammo, studies show that "children taught about firearms and their legitimate uses by family members have much lower rates of delinquency than children in households without guns" and "children introduced to guns associate them with freedom, security, and recreation—not violence."

Gun control laws are racist.
Current gun control laws are frequently aimed at inner city, poor, black communities who are perceived as more dangerous than white gun owners. [94] [95] Charles Gallagher, MA, PhD, the Chair of Sociology at LaSalle University, stated that some gun control laws are still founded on racial fears: "Whites walking down Main Street with an AK-47 are defenders of American values; a black man doing the same thing is Public Enemy No. 1." [96] In the late 1960s, gun control laws were enacted in reaction to the militant, gun-carrying Black Panthers. [97] Adam Winkler, MA, JD, UCLA Constitutional Law Professor, stated "The KKK began as a gun-control organization. Before the Civil War, blacks were never allowed to own guns" so, after the Civil War, there was "constant pressure among white racists to keep guns out of the hands of African Americans because they would rise up and revolt.” [97] In Virginia, in response to Nat Turner's Rebellion (also called the Southampton Rebellion, in which slaves killed 55 to 65 people in the most fatal slave uprising in the United States) in 1831, a law was passed that prohibited free black people "to keep or carry any firelock of any kind, any military weapon, or any powder or lead and all laws allowing free black people to possess firearms were repealed. [98].

The Second Amendment was intended to protect gun ownership of all able-bodied men so that they could participate in the militia to keep the peace and defend the country if needed.
According to the United States Code, a "militia" is composed of all "able-bodied males at least 17 years of age… under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard." [99] Therefore, the militia mentioned in the Second Amendment would have been composed of almost all adult men and, in turn, that most adult men should not have their right to own firearms infringed. [100] A 1792 federal law required that every man eligible for militia service own a gun and ammunition suitable for military service, report for frequent inspection of their guns, and register their gun ownership on public records. [101] Daniel J. Schultz, lawyer, stated, "the Framers [of the Constitution and Bill of Rights] understood that 'well-regulated' militias, that is, armed citizens, ready to form militias that would be well trained, self-regulated and disciplined would post no threat to their fellow citizens, but would, indeed, help to 'insure domestic Tranquility' and 'provide for the common defence.'" [100]

Gun control efforts have proved ineffective.
According to David Lampo, Publications Director of the Cato Institute, "there is no correlation between waiting periods and murder or robbery rates." [102] Banning high-capacity magazines will not necessarily deter crime because even small gun magazines can be changed in seconds.The "gun show loophole" is virtually nonexistent because commercial dealers, who sell the majority of guns at shows and elsewhere, are bound by strict federal laws. [102] According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates, and, of 25 state laws, nine were associated with higher gun death rates. [148]
Did You Know?
A Pew Foundation report found that 79% of male gun owners and 80% of female gun owners said owning a gun made them feel safer, and 64% of people living in a home in which someone else owns a gun felt safer. [58]
The US General Accountability Office (GAO) estimated that 100% of deaths per year in which a child under 6 years old shoots and kills him/herself or another child could be prevented by automatic child-proof safety locks. [35]
The Centers for Disease Control listed firearms as the #12 cause of all deaths between 1999 and 2015, representing 1.3% of total deaths. They were also the #1 method of death by homicide (67.3% of all homicides) and by suicide (51.9% of all suicides). [4]
Mexico has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world and yet, in 2012, Mexico had 11,309 gun murders (9.97 gun homicides per 100,000 people) compared to the United States that had 9,146 gun homicides (2.97 per 100,000 people). [88] [89]
A 1792 federal law signed by President George Washington required that every man eligible for militia service, which meant most able-bodied white men between 18 and 45, own a gun and ammunition suitable for military service. [101]
Five women a day are killed by guns in America. A woman's risk of being murdered increases 500% if a gun is present during a domestic dispute. [10][11]

GUN CONTROL
Gun Control Home Page > Theoretical Expertise Rankings
Theoretical Expertise Rankings
Evaluating the credibility of one person's statements is difficult if not impossible, especially without knowing, for example, each person's background, training, affiliations, education, or experience. However, we feel that a guide to a person's theoretical expertise can be helpful, so we have built theoretical expertise ranking charts for each ProCon.org website to help differentiate the theoretical expertise of the various sources on our sites.
Our Rankings for Sources at Gun Control ProCon.org
Our Methodology
Pros and Cons of Our Theoretical Expertise Ranking System
Some Flaws in Our Theoretical Expertise Ranking
Our Rankings for Sources at Gun Control ProCon.org:
Government Reports and Peer-Reviewed Studies
Official vetted reports from international government bodies (such as the United Nations and the European Union), foreign governments (federal level agencies such as France’s Ministry of Justice, South Africa’s Ministry of Health, or Japan’s office of the Prime Minister), and US government agencies (state, federal, and quasi-government agencies including the Smithsonian Institution, the National Academy of Sciences, and Legal Services Corporation) and peer-reviewed studies from academic journals (such as Science, Nature, New England Journal of Medicine, etc.) tend to have multiple editorial and ideological filters, and they normally receive rigorous review from experts before being formally issued.
Key Experts
We do not believe that this issue has a Key Experts category. [Note: Key Experts definition varies by sites that have this designation.]
Experts
Individuals with PhDs, JDs, or equivalent advanced degrees in fields relevant to guns and gun policies. Also top-level government officials (such as foreign leaders, US presidents, Founding Fathers, Supreme Court Justices, members of legislative bodies, cabinet members, military leaders, etc.) with positions relevant to guns and gun policies.
Media and Academic Journals
Mainstream print, broadcast, radio, and internet media entities such as the New York Times, CNN, ABC News, National Public Radio, Slate.com, Seattlepi.com, etc., as well as influential academic journals such as the Journal of the American Medical Association, Quarterly Journal of Economics, Foreign Policy, etc.
Organizations/VIPs/Others
Individuals and organizations that do not fit into the other star categories.
Our Methodology:
Our theoretical expertise rankings are based upon the following premises:
The courts and many people equate a level of education and knowledge with a person's theoretical expertise.
Although ProCon.org doesn't have the resources to make complex evaluations of the expertise of each contributor to our website and such an evaluation would still contain a fair amount of subjectivity, we believe our theoretical ranking is more desirable than no ranking at all, and that it should be accurate at least 80% of the time.
We have therefore assigned a one through five star rating based on the theoretical expertise each of our sources should possess.
Additionally, we have customized the star categories to each of our sites' specific content because of their different subject matter.
Pros and Cons of Our Theoretical Expertise Ranking System:
Some people have praised our ranking system as a tool for differentiating the theoretical expertise of our sources. Others believe our star system should be eliminated because it is too subjective. The following chart sets out the main Pros and Cons about our theoretical expertise system:
Pro Theoretical Expertise System
Con Theoretical Expertise System
Provides a quick guide to theoretical source quality
Suggesting that one source is more theoretically expert than another reflects bias
Our star system is based on a person's education and knowledge - a concept used in the court system to try and distinguish reliable information
The number of stars prejudges sources for readers rather than allowing readers to judge the sources' expertise for themselves
Stars add a simple and clean visual aid for a source's theoretical expertise
Some 1 star individuals can be more expert than 3 or 4 starred sources. All organizations receive 1 or 2 stars regardless of their actual expertise
We estimate our star system is accurate roughly 80% of the time
We estimate our star system is inaccurate roughly 20% of the time
Some Flaws in Our Theoretical Expertise Ranking:
The following are examples of flaws or problems with our theoretical expertise rankings:
Government Reports - Some have questioned why we have chosen to give government reports our highest rating of five stars.
Our thinking is that government facts and statistics are generally reliable. However, what is less reliable, hence our lower rating, is when government personnel attempt to quote from such facts out of context, or worse when they misuse those facts on purpose or by accident.
For example, we generally would give our highest rating--five stars, to a government report saying that there have been 52,850 killed in auto accidents in a given time period, but we would consider a government employee who said in a speech "Fifty-thousand people died last year in auto accidents" to have less expertise. The government employee would probably receive one, three, or in some cases four stars, depending on the person's education and position.
Star Ranking Challenges at Organizations - We rank most organizations as 1-star because they are often dynamic and subject to myriad influences, thereby making a ranking difficult if not impossible.
Expertise Leap Between One-Star Organizations and Their Five-Star Reports - A government organization would be categorized as a one-star source, but a report issued by that organization would probably receive our five-star ranking.
No Background Verifications - We do not verify the professional or educational background of our sources. For instance, if someone reports that they hold a PhD, MD, or JD degree, then we presume that they hold that degree. We recognize that people may lie on their resumes, but we don't check resumes for accuracy.
Each Site Has a Different Scale - Election officials are 3-star "Experts" on the Voting Machines website, but probably wouldn't be on the Euthanasia website.
Some Expertise Categories Do Not Exist on Other Sites - The Born Gay website lists people with PhD's in Psychology as 4-star "Key Experts" while other sites may not even have a 4-star "Key Expert" category.
Theoretical Expertise Can Change with Events - For example, leaders of Hamas were 1-star sources on the Israeli-Palestinian ProCon.org site until their party won the March 2006 Palestinian elections, and now those same people are considered 3-star sources as government officers.
Determining What Is Mainstream Is Subjective - We classify media and academic journals as 2-star sources that are "mainstream" and "influential." We've done our best to determine what is "mainstream" and "influential" however such distinctions are in themselves subjective.
Doctors Get 4-Stars on Medical Marijuana Site Even if They Know Nothing About Medical Marijuana - On our medical marijuana site physicians receive a 4-star rating based only on their MD degree, with no consideration of their having had any experience with, or knowledge of, medical marijuana. A PhD research scientist with extensive medical marijuana experience receives a 3-star rating.
Some People with Great Actual Expertise Are Ranked as Having Low Theoretical Expertise - Some sources do have not advanced degrees or high-level government positions or other qualifications that would get them a 3 or 4 star ranking even though they may have vast experience and expertise in a subject. For example, Thomas Friedman is a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; however, since he does not have a PhD or hold a government office or otherwise meet the theoretical expertise criteria then he gets our 1-star ranking. Mary Lynn Mathre has a Masters degree in nursing and is a Registered Nurse who has worked closely for decades with patients who use medical marijuana yet she gets a 1-star ranking because she does not have an MD, PhD, JD, judgeship, or hold a government office. Norma Jean Almodovar is the Executive Director of a prostitution-related advocacy group who has worked as a call girl and a cop, yet she gets a 1-star ranking on our prostitution website because she does not have an MD, PhD, JD, or official government position.

State Constitutional Right to Bear Arms
44 US states include the right to bear arms in the state constitutions, some for self-defense and the defense of the state. The oldest of the provisions date to 1776 in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia (though all three have since been revised, the right remains in place). Nebraska was the last state to add a right to bear arms to its constitution in 1988 when the government edited an existing article.
The other 6 states' constitutions do not include the right to bear arms: California, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, and New York.

GUN CONTROL
Last updated on: 8/7/2015 2:48:33 PM PST
School Shootings since Sandy Hook
Jan. 1, 2013 through June 30, 2015
Between the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting on Dec. 14, 2012 and June 30, 2015, there were 122 school shootings. This list includes each instance of a gun being discharged on school property according to information from Everytown for Gun Safety's "School Shootings in America since Sandy Hook," which was then investigated further for accuracy and additional information. Six shootings listed by Everytown were excluded because we could not verify a gun was discharged on school property.
Below the infographic, find a detailed list with information about each of the 122 school shootings.

The United States has 120.5 guns per 100 people, or about 393,347,000 guns, which is the highest total and per capita number in the world. 22% of Americans own one or more guns (35% of men and 12% of women). America's pervasive gun culture stems in part from its colonial history, revolutionary roots, frontier expansion, and the Second Amendment, which states: "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
Proponents of more gun control laws state that the Second Amendment was intended for militias; that gun violence would be reduced; that gun restrictions have always existed; and that a majority of Americans, including gun owners, support new gun restrictions.
Opponents say that the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to own guns; that guns are needed for self-defense from threats ranging from local criminals to foreign invaders; and that gun ownership deters crime rather than causes more crime.
Guns in Colonial and Revolutionary America
Guns were common in the American Colonies, first for hunting and general self-protection and later as weapons in the American Revolutionary War. [105] Several colonies' gun laws required that heads of households (including women) own guns and that all able-bodied men enroll in the militia and carry personal firearms. [105]
Some laws, including in Connecticut (1643) and at least five other colonies, required "at least one adult man in every house to carry a gun to church or other public meetings" in order to protect against attacks by Native Americans; prevent theft of firearms from unattended homes; and, as a 1743 South Carolina law stated, safeguard against "insurrections and other wicked attempts of Negroes and other Slaves." [105] Other laws required immigrants to own guns in order to immigrate or own land. [105]
The Second Amendment of the US Constitution was ratified on Dec. 15, 1791. The notes from the Constitutional Convention do not mention an individual right to a gun for self-defense. [106] Some historians suggest that the idea of an individual versus a collective right would not have occurred to the Founding Fathers because the two were intertwined and inseparable: there was an individual right in order to fulfill the collective right of serving in the militia. [105] [106]
Although guns were common in colonial and revolutionary America, so were gun restrictions. Laws included banning the sale of guns to Native Americans (though colonists frequently traded guns with Native Americans for goods such as corn and fur); banning indentured servants (mainly the Irish) and slaves from owning guns; and exempting a variety of professions from owning guns (including doctors, school masters, lawyers, and millers). [105]

A 1792 federal law required that every man eligible for militia service own a gun and ammunition suitable for military service, report for frequent inspection of their guns, and register his gun ownership on public records. [101] Many Americans owned hunting rifles or pistols instead of proper military guns, and even though the penalty fines were high (over $9,000 in 2014 dollars), they were levied inconsistently and the public largely ignored the law. [105] [106]
State Gun Laws: Slave Codes and the "Wild West"
From the 1700s through the 1800s, so-called "slave codes" and, after slavery was abolished in 1865, "black codes" (and, still later, "Jim Crow" laws) prohibited black people from owning guns and laws allowing the ownership of guns frequently specified "free white men." [98] For example, an 1833 Georgia law stated, "it shall not be lawful for any free person of colour in this state, to own, use, or carry fire arms of any description whatever… that the free person of colour, so detected in owning, using, or carrying fire arms, shall receive upon his bare back, thirty-nine lashes, and that the fire arm so found in the possession of said free person of colour, shall be exposed for public sale." [107]
Despite images of the "Wild West" from movies, cities in the frontier often required visitors to check their guns with the sheriff before entering the town. [108] In Oct. 1876, Deadwood, Dakota Territory passed a law stating that no one could fire a gun without the mayor's consent. [109] A sign in Dodge City, Kansas in 1879 read, "The Carrying of Fire Arms Strictly Prohibited." [108] The first law passed in Dodge City was a gun control law that read "any person or persons found carrying concealed weapons in the city of Dodge or violating the laws of the State shall be dealt with according to law." [108]
Federal Gun Laws in the 1900s
The St. Valentine's Day Massacre on Feb. 14, 1929 in Chicago resulted in the deaths of seven gangsters associated with "Bugs" Moran (an enemy of Al Capone) and set off a series of debates and laws to ban machine guns. [110] [111] Originally enacted in 1934 in response to mafia crimes, the National Firearms Act (NFA) imposes a $200 tax and a registration requirement on the making and transfer of certain guns, including shotguns and rifles with barrels shorter than 18 inches ("short-barreled"), machine guns, firearm mufflers and silencers, and specific firearms labeled as "any other weapons" by the NFA. [112] [113] Most guns are excluded from the Act.
The Federal Firearms Act of 1938 made it illegal to sell guns to certain people (including convicted felons) and required federal firearms licensees (FFLs; people who are licensed by the federal government to sell firearms) to maintain customer records. [114] This Act was overturned by the 1968 Gun Control Act.

Source: Eric Bradner, "Hinckley Won't Face New Charges in Reagan Press Secretary's Death," www.cnn.com, Jan 3, 2015 In 1968 the National Firearms Act was revised to address constitutionality concerns brought up by Haynes v. US (1968), namely that unregistered firearms already in possession of the owner do not have to be registered, and information obtained from NFA applications and registrations cannot be used as evidence in a criminal trial when the crime occurred before or during the filing of the paperwork. [112]
On Oct. 22, 1968, prompted by the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy (1963), Malcolm X (1965), Martin Luther King, Jr. (1968), and Robert F. Kennedy (1968), as well as the 1966 University of Texas mass shooting, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA) into law. [115] The GCA regulates interstate gun commerce, prohibiting interstate transfer unless completed among licensed manufacturers, importers, and dealers, and restricts gun ownership. [114]
The Firearm Owners' Protection Act of 1986 (FOPA) revised prior legislation once again. [112] [113] The Act, among other revisions to prior laws, allowed gun dealers to sell guns away from the address listed on their license; limited the number of inspections the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (now the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) could perform without a warrant; prevented the federal government from maintaining a database of gun dealer records; and removed the requirement that gun dealers keep track of ammunition sales. [114]
The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 (also called the Brady Act) was signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993 and required a five-day waiting period for a licensed seller to hand over a gun to an unlicensed person in states without an alternate background check system. [116] The five-day waiting period has since been replaced by an instant background check system that can take up to three days if there is an inconsistency or more information is needed to complete the sale. [114] Gun owners who have a federal firearms license or a state-issued permit are exempt from the waiting period. [114]
The Federal Assault Weapons Ban (Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act), part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on Sep. 13, 1994. The ban outlawed 19 models of semi-automatic assault weapons by name and others by "military features," as well as large-capacity magazines manufactured after the law's enactment. [114] The ban expired on Sep. 13, 2004 and was not renewed due in part to NRA lobbying efforts. [114] [117]
Federal and State Gun Laws in the 2000s
Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and Child Safety Lock Act of 2005 was enacted on Oct. 26 by President George W. Bush and gives broad civil liability immunity to firearms manufacturers so they cannot be sued by a gun death victim's family. [114] [118] The Child Safety Lock Act requires that all handguns be sold with a "secure gun storage or safety device."[119]
The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 was enacted as a condition of the Brady Act and provides incentives to states (including grants from the Attorney General) for them to provide information to NICS including information on people who are prohibited from purchasing firearms. [114] The NICS was implemented on Nov. 30, 1998 and later amended on Jan. 8, 2008 in response to the Apr. 16, 2007 Virginia Tech University shooting so that the Attorney General could more easily acquire information pertinent to background checks such as disqualifying mental conditions. [120]
On Jan. 5, 2016, President Obama announced new executive actions on gun control. His measures take effect immediately and include: an update and expansion of background checks (closing the "gun show loophole"); the addition of 200 ATF agents; increased mental health care funding; $4 million and personnel to enhance the National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (used to link crimes in one jurisdiction to ballistics evidence in another); creating an Internet Investigations Center to track illegal online gun trafficking; a new Department of Health and Human Services rule saying that it is not a HIPAA violation to report mental health information to the background check system; a new requirement to report gun thefts; new research funding for gun safety technologies; and more funding to train law enforcement officers on preventing gun casualties in domestic violence cases.

In addition to federal gun laws, each state has its own set of gun laws ranging from California with the most restrictive gun laws in the country to Arizona with the most lenient, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the Brady Campaign's "2013 State Scorecard." [121]. 43 of 50 states have a "right to bear arms" clause in their state constitutions. [101]
The most common state gun control laws include background checks, waiting periods, and registration requirements to purchase or sell guns. [121] [122] Most states prevent carrying guns, including people with a concealed carry permit, on K-12 school grounds and many states prevent carrying on college campuses. [121] [122] Some states ban assault weapons. [121] [122]
Gun rights laws include concealed and open carry permits, as well as allowing gun carry in usually restricted areas (such as bars, K-12 schools, state parks, and parking areas). [121] [122] Many states have "shoot first" (also called "stand your ground") laws. [121] [122] Open carry of handguns is generally allowed in most states (though a permit may be required). [121] [122]
Collective v. Individual Right: Guns and the Supreme Court
Until 2008, the Supreme Court repeatedly upheld a collective right (that the right to own guns is for the purpose of maintaining a militia) view of the Second Amendment, concluding that the states may form militias and regulate guns. [47]
The first time the Court upheld an individual rights interpretation (that individuals have a Constitutional right to own a gun regardless of militia service) of the Second Amendment was the June 26, 2008 US Supreme Court ruling in DC v. Heller. The Court stated that the right could be limited: "There seems to us no doubt, on the basis of both text and history, that the Second Amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms. Of course the right was not unlimited… Thus we do not read the Second Amendment to protect the right of citizens to carry arms for any sort of confrontation, just as we do not read the First Amendment to protect the right of citizens to speak for any purpose." [1] [3]

A portrait of General Ambrose Burnside, first president of the NRA

The US Supreme Court ruled on June 28, 2010 in McDonald v. Chicago that the Fourteenth Amendment, specifically the Due Process Clause, includes the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and, thus, the Second Amendment applies to the states as well as the federal government, effectively extending the individual rights interpretation of the Second Amendment to the states. [123]
On June 27, 2016, in Voisine v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled (6-2) that someone convicted of "recklessly" committing a violent domestic assault can be disqualified from owning a gun under the 1996 Lautenberg Amendment to the 1968 Gun Control Act. Associate Justice Elena Kagan, JD, writing the majority opinion, stated: "Congress enacted §922(g)(9) [the Lautenberg Amendment] in 1996 to bar those domestic abusers convicted of garden-variety assault or battery misdemeanors--just like those convicted of felonies--from owning guns." [150] [151] [152] [153]
On Feb. 20, 2018, the US Supreme Court indicated it would not hear an appeal to California's 10-day waiting period for gun buyers, thus leaving the waiting period in place. [156] Justice Clarence Thomas said the Court should have heard the challenge, stating "The right to keep and bear arms is apparently this Court's constitutional orphan," in reference to the Court not hearing a major Second Amendment case since 2010. [156]
The National Rifle Association (NRA)
The National Rifle Association calls itself "America's longest-standing civil rights organization." [124] Granted charter on Nov. 17, 1871 in New York, Civil War Union veterans Colonel William C. Church and General George Wingate founded the NRA to "promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis" to improve the marksmanship of Union troops. [125] General Ambrose Burnside, governor of Rhode Island (1866 to 1869) and US Senator (Mar. 4, 1875 to Sep. 13, 1881), was the first president. [125] [126]
Over 100 years later, in 1977, in what is known as the "Revolt at Cincinnati," new leadership changed the bylaws to make the protection of the Second Amendment right to bear arms the primary focus (ousting the focus on sportsmanship). [127] [128] The group lobbied to disassemble the Gun Control Act of 1968 (the NRA alleged the Act gave power to the ATF that was abused), which they accomplished in 1986 with the Firearms Owners Protection Act. [127]
In 1993 the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) funded a study completed by Arthur Kellerman and colleagues, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, titled "Gun Ownership as a Risk Factor in the Home," which found that keeping a gun at home increased the risk of homicide. [129] [130] [131] The NRA accused the CDC of "promoting the idea that gun ownership was a disease that needed to be eradicated," and argued that government funding should not be available to politically motivated studies. [129] [130] [131] The NRA notched a victory when Congress passed the Dickey Amendment, which deducted $2.6 billion from the CDC's budget, the exact amount of its gun research program, and restricted CDC (and, later, NIH) gun research. [129] [130] [131] The amendment stated that "none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control." [129] [130] [131] The admonition effectively stopped all federal gun research because, as Kellerman stated, "[p]recisely what was or was not permitted under the clause was unclear. But no federal employee was willing to risk his or her career or the agency's funding to find out." [130] Jay Dickey (R-AR), now retired from Congress, was the author of the Dickey Amendment and has since stated that he no longer supports the amendment: "I wish we had started the proper research and kept it going all this time... I have regrets." [144]
As of Jan. 2013, the NRA had approximately 3 million members, though estimates have varied from 2.6 million to 5 million members. [132] In 2013 the NRA spending budget was $290.6 million. [133] The NRA-ILA actively lobbies against universal checks and registration, "large" magazine and "assault weapons" bans, requiring smart gun features, ballistic fingerprinting, firearm traces, and prohibiting people on the terrorist watchlist from owning guns; and in favor of self-defense (stand your ground) laws. [134] In 2014 the NRA and NRA-ILA spent $3.36 million on lobbying activity aimed primarily at Congress but also the US Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Army Corps of Engineers, and the Forest Service. [135]
The Gun Control Lobby
The start of the modern gun control movement is largely attributed to Mark Borinsky, PhD, who founded the National Center to Control Handguns (NCCH) in 1974. [136] After being the victim of an armed robbery, Borinsky looked for a gun control group to join but found none, founded NCCH, and worked to grow the organization with Edward O. Welles, a retired CIA officer, and N.T. "Pete" Shields, a Du Pont executive whose son was shot and killed in 1975. [136]

In 2001, after a few name changes, the National Center to Control Handguns (NCCH) was renamed the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and its sister organization, the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, was renamed the Brady Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, though they are often referred to collectively as the Brady Campaign. [137] The groups were named for Jim Brady, a press secretary to President Ronald Reagan who was shot and permanently disabled on Mar. 30, 1981 during an assassination attempt on the President. [137]
The 2014 gun control lobby was composed of Everytown for Gun Safety, Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, Sandy Hook Promise, Americans for Responsible Solutions, and Violence Policy Center. [138] Collectively, these groups spent $1.94 million in 2014, primarily aimed at Congress but also the Executive Office of the President, the Vice President, the White House, Department of Justice, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. [138]
The most-recently available total annual spending budgets for gun control groups were $13.7 million collectively (4.7% of the NRA's 2013 budget): including Everytown for Gun Safety ($4.7 million in 2012); the Brady Campaign ($2.7 million in 2012); the Brady Center ($3.1 million in 2010); Coalition to Stop Gun Violence ($308,761 in 2011); Sandy Hook Promise ($2.2 million in 2013); and the Violence Policy Center ($750,311 in 2012). [133]
The Current Gun Control Debate
Largely, the current public gun control debate in the United States occurs after a major mass shooting. There were at least 126 mass shootings between Jan. 2000 and July 2014. [139] [140] Proponents of more gun control often want more laws to try to prevent the mass shootings and call for smart gun laws, background checks, and more protections against the mentally ill buying guns. Opponents of more gun laws accuse proponents of using a tragedy to further a lost cause, stating that more laws would not have prevented the shootings. A Dec. 10, 2014 Pew Research Center survey found 52% of Americans believe the right to own guns should be protected while 46% believe gun ownership should be controlled, a switch from 1993 when 34% wanted gun rights protected and 57% wanted gun ownership controlled. [141] According to a Feb. 20, 2018 Quinnipiac Poll taken shortly after the Feb. 14 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, 66% of American voters support stricter gun control laws. [155]
On Dec. 18, 2018, the US Justice Department announced a new rule banning bump stocks, a gun attachment that allows a semi-automatic gun to fire rapidly like an automatic weapon. The new rule will classify bump stocks as machine guns, which will ban them nationwide under existing gun control laws. [161]

The Real Top 20 Causes of Death
1999-2016
572,537 people died of gunshots between the 18 years of 1999 and 2016, an average of 31,807 deaths per year. But, the CDC resource "20 Leading Causes of Death," does not list firearms as a cause, even though nine of the 20 causes had fewer than 572,537 deaths during that time. Where did all of those firearms deaths go?
It turns out the CDC split gun deaths (as well as other non-disease causes) into three categories: unintentional injury, suicide, and homicide. We dug into those three categories, and added in legal intervention and undetermined intent deaths, to produce "The Real Top 20 Causes of Death," which includes traffic accidents, poisoning, firearms, falls, and suffocation, none of which appeared in the CDC's original Top 20.

GUN CONTROL

American Academy of Pediatrics Biography
Position:
Pro to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"[T]he absence of guns from children’s homes and communities is the most reliable and effective measure to prevent firearm-related injuries in children and adolescents.
The AAP continues to support a number of specific measures to reduce the destructive effects of guns in the lives of children and adolescents through the implementation of the following recommendations:
Enact a strong, effective assault weapon ban;
Eliminate the gun show loophole and require mandatory background checks and waiting periods before all firearm purchases;
Ban on high capacity magazines;
Enact strong handgun regulations; and
Require safe firearm storage under federal law."
"American Academy of Pediatrics Gun Violence Policy Recommendations," www.aap.org, Jan. 2013
Theoretical Expertise Ranking:
Organizations/VIPs/OthersIndividuals and organizations that do not fit into the other star categories.
Description:
"The AAP is a professional membership organization of 62,000 primary care pediatricians, pediatric medical sub-specialists and pediatric surgical specialists dedicated to the health, safety, and well being of infants, children, adolescents and young adults... AAP recommendations form the basis of pediatric preventive health care. The AAP issues policy statements, clinical reports, technical reports and practice guidelines on a broad range of topics. The AAP collaborates with two other organizations to produce the annual recommended immunization schedules for children and adolescents used by schools, public health agencies and pediatricians. The AAP advocates for access to health care for all children, adolescents and young adults. The AAP believes that each child should have a 'medical home'—a model of health care where care is accessible, family-centered, continuous, comprehensive, coordinated, compassionate and culturally effective. The AAP works with government, communities and other national organizations to shape many child health and safety issues... The AAP was founded in 1930 by 35 pediatricians to serve as an independent forum to address children's health needs. At that time, the idea that children had unique developmental and health needs was new. Practices that are now standard preventive care (i.e., immunization, regular health exams) were only just beginning to change the custom of treating children as 'miniature adults.' The Academy also maintains the Pediatric History Center, which collects and archives materials related to the history of pediatrics in the United States and Canada and the history of the Academy itself."
"AAP Facts," www.aap.org (accessed Apr. 20, 2015)
Mission:
"The mission of the American Academy of Pediatrics is to attain optimal physical, mental, and social health and well-being for all infants, children, adolescents and young adults. To accomplish this, AAP shall support the professional needs of its members."

Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence Biography
Position:
Pro to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"The Brady Campaign supports a policy platform that addresses the problem of gun violence and is driven by the opportunity to save the most lives. Every death is a tragedy, whether in a mass shooting that horrifies our entire nation, or one of the 32 gun murders or 90 gun deaths in our communities and homes every day… Policies such as 'universal background checks' on all gun sales would keep guns out of the hands of felons, domestic abusers, the dangerously mentally ill and other illegal purchasers without impacting anyone else's Second Amendment right to own guns. Background checks are supported by the overwhelming majority of Americans, including gun owners, and they make us all safer."
"Changing Laws," www.bradycampaign.org (accessed Mar. 26, 2015)
Theoretical Expertise Ranking:

Description:
"The Brady Campaign supports a policy platform that addresses the problem of gun violence and is driven by the opportunity to save the most lives. Every death is a tragedy, whether in a mass shooting that horrifies our entire nation, or one of the 32 gun murders or 90 gun deaths in our communities and homes every day. We applaud the Obama Administration, members of Congress, and others at the federal and state level who are leading a policy conversation based on our common goals and values, avoiding the usual, divisive political debate. Policies such as 'universal background checks' on all gun sales would keep guns out of the hands of felons, domestic abusers, the dangerously mentally ill and other illegal purchasers without impacting anyone else’s Second Amendment right to own guns. Background checks are supported by the overwhelming majority of Americans, including gun owners, and they make us all safer."
"Changing Laws," www.bradycampaign.org (accessed Apr. 21, 2015)
Mission:
"Of the 32,000 people who die from gun violence in this country each year, how many could be saved? Brady's strategic approach of legal action against bad apple gun dealers, extending background checks and changing social norms around guns seeks to change this tragic reality."

GUN CONTROL

Coalition to Stop Gun Violence Biography
Position:
Pro to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"Approximately 40% of gun sales are made without any background check—giving convicted felons, the dangerously mentally ill and others unchecked access to firearms. It’s long past time to require a background check on every gun sale in America…
Semiautomatic, military-style firearms are designed for one purpose: to kill people en masse, and quickly. They have no place on our streets, and are a threat to law enforcements officers and civilians alike…
Mental health screening for gun buyers in the United States is shallow, arbitrary and often unfair. A new standard must be developed that focuses on dangerousness—whether or not someone with mental illness presents a threat to self or others."

Gabrielle Giffords, MRP Biography
Title:
Cofounder of Americans for Responsible Solutions and Former US Representative (D-AZ)
Position:
Pro to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"We need a comprehensive approach: a surge in mental health services, mental health 'first aid' programs to identify and intervene in problems before it's too late, and a background check system that will stop the most dangerous among us from buying guns, by getting records in the system and closing the Internet and gun-show loopholes…
We have done our homework, and the numbers don't lie: From Texas to New Hampshire and everywhere in between, we know that support for policies such as expanded background checks continue to be popular in both parties. Gun owners and non-gun owners alike agree on expanding background checks, making gun trafficking a serious crime with stiff penalties, making it illegal for all stalkers and all domestic abusers to buy guns, and expanding mental health resources so the mentally ill find it easier to receive treatment than to buy firearms."

GUN CONTROL

Daniel Webster, ScD, MPH Biography
Title:
Director of the Center for Gun Policy and Research at Johns Hopkins University
Position:
Pro to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"When criminals get guns, they get them from friends, family, or from an underground market source. Without universal background check requirements, there is little deterrent to selling guns to criminals or gun traffickers. State laws mandating universal background checks deter the diversion of guns to criminals. The most comprehensive screening and background check processes, where potential gun purchasers apply in person for permits to purchase handguns, are associated with lower homicide and suicide rates…
Better regulation of gun sales is only part of the solution. Policies should make it extremely risky for criminals to illegally carry and use guns, and we must expand efforts to diffuse conflicts involving high-risk individuals before they are settled with guns."
"Guns Kill People. And If We Had Universal Background Checks, They Wouldn't Kill So Many," www.newrepublic.com, June 26, 2014

Monte E. Frank, JD Biography
Title:
Attorney and Legal Advisor to Newton Action Alliance
Position:
Pro to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"Let's ignore this vocal fringe group, some of whom openly advocate treason (in violation of article 3 section 3 of the constitution). Instead, Americans must come together to call for Congress to put politics aside and pass common-sense measures that the majority of Americans, including gun owners, support…
[W]e need to ban military-style weapons and 30-round magazines, so that when the next unstable individual slips through the cracks in our healthcare system, their ability to access an assault weapon won't be easier than buying a beer…
[A] federal anti-trafficking bill that includes real penalties for 'straw buyers' is imperative, since firearms are being transported through many states. A strong bill will dry up the 'iron pipeline', the supply of cheap and plentiful firearms into our cities…
Finally, universal background checks would help reduce the risk of a firearm ending up in the hands of a criminal, a person affected by mental illness, or a terrorist. Currently, under federal law, a person on our terrorist watchlist can buy the Bushmaster AR-15 – the weapon used at both the Sandy Hook elementary school and at the Aurora movie theater – in a private transaction, without any questions being asked."

GUN CONTROL

Barack Obama, JD Biography
Title:
44th President of the United States
Position:
Pro to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"It has been two months since Newtown. I know this is not the first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence. But this time is different. Overwhelming majorities of Americans -- Americans who believe in the Second Amendment -- have come together around common-sense reform, like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun. Senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals. Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets, because these police chiefs, they’re tired of seeing their guys and gals being outgunned.
Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress…. Because in the two months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays, graduations, anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun -- more than a thousand."

GUN CONTROL
Last updated on: 4/22/2015 10:37:50 AM PST

John E. Rosenthal Biography
Title:
Cofounder of Stop Handgun Violence
Position:
Pro to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"I believe that, as a gun owner, I have a responsibility to my family and my community to store my gun safely, locked and unloaded. I also have a responsibility to advocate for responsible gun laws that help keep guns out of dangerous people's hands. That includes being willing to submit to a background check every time I purchase a firearm and expecting buyers to submit to a current background check if I sell them a gun. Furthermore, I believe that if I misuse my gun, for example if I violently threaten a family member or allow a child to gain access to a loaded and unlocked firearm, I should be held accountable for my actions…
Being concerned about the thirty-thousand-plus gun deaths each year in the United States does not make you anti-gun. And advocating for policies that make a dangerous product a little less dangerous just means you care about saving lives and countless grief from preventable firearm injuries and death. However, this message is so controversial that the gun industry, who thinks the Second Amendments trumps the First, wants to silence it."

Piers Morgan Biography
Title:
Journalist and TV Personality
Position:
Pro to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"I assumed that after 70 people were shot in a movie theater, and then, just a few months later, 20 first-graders were murdered with an assault rifle in an elementary school, the absurd gun laws in this country would change. But nothing has happened…
My point is simple: More guns doesn't mean less crime, as the NRA repeatedly tries to tell you. It means more gun violence, more death and more profits for the gun manufacturers. And to those who claim my gun control campaigning has been 'anti-American,' well, the reverse is true. I am so pro-American that I want more of you to stay alive. But I've made my point. I've given it a tremendous whack. Now it's down to you. It's your country; these are your gun laws. And the senseless slaughter will only end when enough Americans stand together and cry: 'Enough!'"

GUN CONTROL
Last updated on: 4/24/2015 9:49:01 AM PST

Michael Bloomberg, MBA Biography
Title:
Former New York City Mayor and Cofounder of Mayors Against Illegal Guns
Position:
Pro to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"First and most urgently, we need the President and Congress together to require background checks for all gun sales – including private sales at gun shows and online. These private sales now account for more than 40 percent of all gun sales nationally – which means that in 2012 alone, there were more than six million gun sales that happened with no background checks…
Second, Congress should make gun trafficking a Federal crime. In New York City, 85 percent of the weapons that we recover from crime scenes come from out-of-state sources – but Federal laws designed to curb illegal sales across borders are incredibly weak. Criminals who traffic get a slap on the wrist…
The third legislative measure that the White House should support is limiting the availability of military-style weapons and high-capacity magazines with more than ten rounds. These guns and equipment are not designed for sport or home defense. They are designed to kill large numbers of people quickly. That’s the only purpose they have."
"Mayor Bloomberg Delivers Opening Address at Johns Hopkins University Summit on Reducing Gun Violence in America," www1.nyc.gov, Jan. 14, 2013

Liam Neeson Biography
Title:
Actor
Position:
Pro to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"I am totally for gun control in the US… The population of America is roughly 300 million and there are 300 million guns in this country, which is terrifying. Every day we’re seeing some kid running rampant in a school. And do you know what the gun lobby's response to Newtown was?
The National Rifle Association's official response was 'If that teacher had been armed…' It's crazy. I'll give Britain its dues, when they had the Dunblane massacre in Scotland, within 24 hours the gun laws were changed so you could not have a handgun."
"Liam Neeson Interview: Hard Man Actor on Bono, Ralph Fiennes and His Fear of Guns," www.independent.co.uk, Sep. 12, 2014

Jim Zumbo Biography
Title:
Former Hunting Editor for Outdoor Life
Position:
Now Con to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"In the matter of the pro-con firearms issue, I want to be on record as opposing any more gun control."
Email to ProCon.org, June 8, 2015
[Editor's Note: Prior to the June 8, 2015 statement above, Jim Zumbo was classified as "Pro" based on his Feb. 16, 2007 blog post in Outdoor Life titled "Assault Rifles for Hunters?," quoted below.]"The guides on our hunt tell me that the use of AR and AK rifles have a rapidly growing following among hunters, especially prairie dog hunters. I had no clue…
Excuse me, maybe I'm a traditionalist, but I see no place for these weapons among our hunting fraternity. I'll go so far as to call them 'terrorist' rifles.
To most of the public, an assault rifle is a terrifying thing. Let's divorce ourselves from them. I say game departments should ban them from the prairies and woods."
"Assault Rifles for Hunters?," www.razoreye.net, Feb. 16, 2007

GUN CONTROL

John Walsh Biography
Title:
Creator and Former Host of America's Most Wanted
Position:
Pro to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"I've seen what guns do in America. I'm gun owner. I know about guns and I have guns, and I believe we need reasonable gun control. Many countries have all kinds of safeguards, and none have the violence we have—there were 11 murders in Chicago last weekend. I talked to the president and vice president about reasonable background checks—that’s all I'm talking about. We're the richest country on the planet and we have the most violence. All the capitals of Western Europe combined don't have as many homicides as Chicago does…
We've got to start somewhere, with reasonable gun control. We need to have what this country doesn't have: A reasonable mental health system so when you go for a gun, they can see if you're under psychiatric care — all the things you need to do in Canada or New Zealand or Australia or Japan. The things I'm proposing to the NRA are so simple and so much-needed because we're a country of 350 million with about 450 million guns. There's a way to start, and that's some reasonable gun registration and background checks. So when people get upset about that — I'm a gun owner; no one's gonna take my shotguns away or my 9 millimeters away. I'm probably the only guy in America who needs guns, I get so many death threats from nutcases."

GUN CONTROL

Al Sharpton Biography
Title:
Baptist Minister and Civil Rights Activist
Position:
Pro to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"Gun supporters and advocates always champion the 2nd Amendment and our right to bear arms. But this right doesn't mean that everyone should possess a weapon. It doesn't mean guns should be so readily accessible to the least stable among us. And it doesn't mean that we don't need stricter gun laws to keep them out of the hands of criminals and those with a complete disregard for human life. Perhaps the fierce gun proponents need to take a walk in our neighborhoods, where young children have to dodge bullets just to get an education, or where mothers and fathers spend sleepless nights figuring out ways to keep their families safe...
[W]e cannot continue to bury our precious ones. Life is indeed short, but let's not make it shorter by killing one another needlessly. Get guns out of the community and stop them from ever finding their way back in. Together, we can save ourselves -- and the next generation."

GUN CONTROL
Last updated on: 4/27/2015 11:43:45 AM PST
Gun Control Home Page > Source Biographies > >Democratic National Committee
Democratic National Committee Biography
Position:
Pro to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"We recognize that the individual right to bear arms is an important part of the American tradition, and we will preserve Americans’ Second Amendment right to own and use firearms. We believe that the right to own firearms is subject to reasonable regulation. We understand the terrible consequences of gun violence; it serves as a reminder that life is fragile, and our time here is limited and precious. We believe in an honest, open national conversation about firearms. We can focus on effective enforcement of existing laws, especially strengthening our background check system, and we can work together to enact commonsense improvements–like reinstating the assault weapons ban and closing the gun show loophole–so that guns do not fall into the hands of those irresponsible, law-breaking few."
"Moving America Forward 2012 Democratic National Platform," www.democrats.org, 2012
Theoretical Expertise Ranking:
Organizations/VIPs/OthersIndividuals and organizations that do not fit into the other star categories.
Description:
"The Democratic National Committee, or DNC, was created during the Democratic National Convention of 1848. For 167 years, it’s been responsible for governing the Democratic Party and is the oldest continuing party committee in the United States.The Committee, which plans the Party’s presidential nominating convention and promotes the Democratic Platform, the statement of core principles at the heart of our Party, is governed by its Charter and Bylaws.The DNC also raises money, hires staff, and coordinates strategy to support candidates throughout the country for local, state, and national office.Additionally, the Committee works with various constituencies to respond to the needs and views of Democrats across the nation.Under the leadership of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the DNC is composed of the chairs and vice-chairs of each state Democratic Party Committee and over 200 members elected by Democrats in all 50 states and the territories."
"Democratic National Committee," www.democrats.org (accessed Mar. 27, 2015)
Mission:
"Since 1848, the Democratic National Committee has been the home of the Democratic Party, the oldest continuing party in the United States.Today we are millions of supporters strong, fighting for progress and helping elect Democrats across the country to state government, Congress, and the White House.There are several core beliefs that tie our party together: Democrats believe that we're greater together than we are on our own—that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same rules. Our party, led by President Obama, is focused on building an economy that lifts up all Americans, not just those at the top.That's why Democrats are working to make progress on issues like job creation, equal pay, education, health care, and clean energy."

GUN CONTROL
Last updated on: 4/27/2015 12:12:21 PM PST
Gun Control Home Page > Source Biographies > >Ted Cruz, JD
Ted Cruz, JD Biography
Title:
US Senator (R-TX)
Position:
Con to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"What I think is two things, number one, that restricting the right to keep and bear arms is unconstitutional.
The Second Amendment is an integral part of the Bill of Rights. And what it means is, politicians cannot come and strip the guns from law-abiding Americans. But, number two, it's misguided policy. If you look at the jurisdictions with the strictest gun control laws, almost without exception, they have the highest crime rates and the highest murder rates.
If you look at the jurisdictions that most vigorously protect our right to keep and bear arms, almost without exception, they have the lowest crime rates and the lowest murder rates. Gun control policies don't work. And they're contrary to the Constitution."

Paul Ryan Biography
Title:
US Representative (R-WI)
Position:
Con to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"I have a lot of guns. I'm a big hunter. I've been shooting guns since I was a kid. I'm very familiar with how these weapons operate, with how semiautomatics operate. I think you’re getting to the point where you're making changes in law that won't make a difference [such as large clip bans] and you're compromising people's Second Amendment rights.
There are legitimate reasons for citizens to own these weapons [assault weapons]. Whether it's for hunting. People do use these for hunting. Whether it's for target shooting or self-defense. There are legitimate reasons for people owning these guns.
We've got 310 million guns in this country. You really think we're going to stop these guns? We still had Columbine during that time [of the the assault weapons ban]. The point I'm saying is why did the kid do that? What's wrong with our culture, or what's wrong with our system, where a person who is clearly mentally ill, missed all the checks to get him the help he needed to prevent that from happening."

Rick Perry Biography
Title:
Secretary of Energy
Position:
Con to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"Guns require a finger to pull the trigger. The sad young man who did that in Newtown was clearly haunted by demons and no gun law could have saved the children in Sandy Hook Elementary from his terror…
In fact, the piling on by the political left, and their cohorts in the media, to use the massacre of little children to advance a pre-existing political agenda that would not have saved those children, disgusts me, personally. The second amendment to the Constitution is a basic right of free people and cannot be nor will it be abridged by the executive power of this or any other president."
Jim Hoft, "TX Gov. Perry: The Piling on by Political Left to Use Massacre of Children to Advance Political Agenda Disgusts Me," www.thegatewaypundit.com, Jan. 16, 2013

Chris Cox Biography
Title:
Executive Director of the NRA-ILA
Position:
Con to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"Unfortunately this is another tragedy [referring to the May 23, 2014 University of Santa Barbara shooting] that was not prevented by gun control and there's not one more... there is not another gun control law that could have been passed that would have prevented this awful situation from happening.
We can't forget that the first three victims were stabbed to death. Now that's not something that the national news media wants to talk about. A number of victims were hit by a car, gun control obviously wouldn't have prevented that behavior either. They have very strict mental health rules with regards to firearm ownership in California. There are things that can and should be done, the National Rifle Association is interested in addressing these underlying problems. We have underlying problems with a lack of school security, a lack of armed security in our schools. We have a problem with a lack of prosecution coming out of [Attorney General] Eric Holder and Barack Obama's administration, and we have a problem, no question, with regards to these gun control laws that leave people defenseless, and we have a problem with a mental health system that's completely bankrupt…
[T]he blame needs to be placed on the politicians in California who time and time again their answer to these issues are more and more gun control laws. They have passed every gun control law imaginable and it hasn't done a… thing, and that's a tragedy in and of itself."

GUN CONTROL

Buz Williams Biography
Title:
Former Long Beach, CA Police Sergeant
Position:
Con to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"Let's look at the crimes committed by Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook Elementary School killer. First, he killed his mother. Then he stole his mother’s guns… I think it is a safe bet that Lanza broke some laws transporting loaded firearms. It is almost certainly against the law to enter a school with a loaded firearm… In addition to killing 26 people, Lanza committed an undisclosed number of attempt [sic] murders, at least one burglary when he entered the school after shooting off the lock, and probably a plethora of other crimes, including but not limited to, shooting into an inhabited building, shooting within city limits and negligent firearms use. If we tighten our gun control laws, if we enact more and 'tougher' gun control laws, won't that just be more, tighter and tougher laws that sociopaths can ignore? We don't need more and/or tighter gun control."

GUN CONTROL

John R. Lott, PhD Biography
Title:
Founder and President of Crime Prevention Research Center
Position:
Con to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"In the wake of tragedies such as Newtown, gun control advocates keep pushing for more restrictions. But the proposed regulations have nothing to do with the tragedies…
Even worse for gun control advocates, people are realizing that regulations — such as gun-free zones — tend to encourage attacks by disarming law-abiding citizens instead of criminals.
Hopefully, cities such as Washington, Los Angeles and New York will change their rules as more poor blacks and women recognize the benefits of gun ownership. At present, only rich, well-connected people can get concealed carry permits in those places. The poor have every bit as much right to defend themselves."
"Why Most Americans Oppose More Gun Control," www.foxnews.com, Dec. 30, 2014
Theoretical Expertise Ranking:
ExpertsIndividuals with PhDs, JDs, or equivalent advanced degrees in fields relevant to guns and gun policies. Also top-level government officials (such as foreign leaders, US presidents, Founding Fathers, Supreme Court Justices, members of legislative bodies, cabinet members, military leaders, etc.) with positions relevant to guns and gun policies.

GUN CONTROL
Last updated on: 4/28/2015 1:31:52 PM PST
Gun Control Home Page > Source Biographies > >National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA)
National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA) Biography
Position:
Con to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"[M]ost criminals obtain guns from theft, the black market, or 'straw purchasers'—people who can pass a background check and who buy guns for criminals. Furthermore, none of the high-profile crimes that they cite involved guns bought without a background check…
Americans own well over 100 million 'large' magazines and the nation's murder rate is nearly at an all-time low…
'Assault weapon' is the term that gun control supporters use to malign general-purpose rifles like the AR-15. Americans now own five million AR-15s, the number is growing by several hundred thousand annually, and the nation’s murder rate is down by more than half since 1991…
NRA opposes requiring guns to be made with electronic equipment that would allow the guns to be deactivated remotely, or with other features that gun owners do not want…
Gun control supporters want markings on bullets and cartridge cases fired from new handguns to be entered into a database. NRA opposes it, because enforcing it would require gun registration…
NRA opposes legislation to prohibit the possession of firearms by people on the watchlist, because the FBI will not say who is on the list or why, and the legislation would violate the 5th Amendment by preventing a watchlisted person from challenging the FBI in a fair and open hearing in court.
'Gun Control' Doesn't Work."
"2014 NRA-ILA Firearms Fact Card," www.nraila.org, Mar. 26, 2014
Theoretical Expertise Ranking:
Organizations/VIPs/OthersIndividuals and organizations that do not fit into the other star categories.
Description:
"The Institute is also involved in educating the public about the facts concerning the many facets of firearms ownership in America. Through the distribution of millions of printed fact sheets, brochures and articles annually and the posting information and the latest news daily on its Internet site (www.nraila.org), the Institute provides facts about responsible firearms ownership, the Second Amendment and other topics.In NRA Headquarters in Fairfax, Va., and in offices in Washington, D.C., and in Sacramento, Calif., the Institute employs a staff of more than 80, with a team of full-time lobbyists defending Second Amendment issues on Capitol Hill, in state legislatures and in local government bodies.While NRA is a single-issue organization, the Institute is involved in any issue that directly or indirectly affects firearms ownership and use. These involve such topics as hunting and access to hunting lands, wilderness and wildlife conservation, civilian marksmanship training and ranges for public use, law enforcement-related issues, product liability, trapping, crime victim rights and criminal justice reform."
"About the NRA Institute for Legislative Action," www.nra-ila.org.about (accessed Apr. 28, 2015)
Mission:
"The Institute for Legislative Action (ILA) is the lobbying arm of the NRA. Established in 1975, ILA is committed to preserving the right of all law-abiding individuals to purchase, possess and use firearms for legitimate purposes as guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.ILA's ability to fight successfully for the rights of America's law-abiding gun owners directly reflects the support of NRA's nearly 5 million members—a number that has more than tripled since 1978. When restrictive 'gun control' legislation is proposed at the local, state or federal level, NRA members and supporters are alerted and respond with individual letters, faxes, e-mails and calls to their elected representatives to make their views known."

Sarah Palin Biography
Title:
Former Alaska Governor
Position:
Con to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"Every day we are seeing more and more efforts to strip away our Second Amendment rights. And our founders knew that our inherent right to defend life and property and freedom, it had to be enshrined. It was enshrined in America's most perfect blueprint to form a more perfect union. Of course our Constitution. So it was enshrined and they knew that if the Second Amendment goes, the rest of the Constitution is not far behind. They are trying though. They, you know who they are. Look, if you control oil, you control an economy. If you control money, you control commerce. But, if you control arms, you control people. And that is what they're trying…
And I love our police. I do. But they can't be everywhere, you know, so maybe our kids can be defended against criminals on the spot if more mama grizzlies carried. And Obama administration wants you ID'd for that? Well, then, just go ahead and carry a sign too. A sign that says, 'Yeah, I carry a gun, because a cop is too heavy.'
Aren't they something though? Aren't they something? Blaming that chunk of steel, you know, the weapon itself for the crime committed. They even blame sporting goods stores that sell arms, accusing them of being an accomplice. MmmHmm. Gun stores are an accomplice to crime. And that fork made me fat."

Aaron Zelman Biography
Title:
Late Founder and Executive Director of Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership
Position:
Con to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"Our main goal is to destroy gun control. We are an organization that believes we have the moral authority to point out to the rest of the world the evils that have come from gun control and how humanity has suffered because of gun-control schemes…
I think there are numerous threats, but one is that the American public really doesn't understand a need for an armed citizenry. Our country became independent because citizens were armed. This is why an organized, state-controlled militia received attention in the U.S. Constitution. So we have a lot of work to do. We have to reach out to people and help them understand why citizens must be armed, and what's happened to citizens throughout the world and throughout history when they couldn't defend themselves against a government gone bad."

GUN CONTROL

Rick Santorum, MBA, JD Biography
Title:
Former US Senator and Representative (R-PA)
Position:
Con to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"I think a well-armed family is a safe family; a well-armed America is a safer America. I think if you look at anything, from all of these attacks that have taken place, is if people actually had had weapons there those attacks would have been thwarted and people's lives would have been saved.
In fact, there are millions of lives that are saved in America every year, millions of instances where gun owners have prevented crimes and stopped things from happening because of having guns at the scene…
You know, everybody romanticizes the O.K. Corral and all the horrible things that happened, but gun crimes were not very prevalent back then. Why? Because people carried guns. And, you know, the folks who use guns in the commission of crimes are cowards. And if you look at going to theatres, they went to a theatre in Aurora, Colorado, that they knew, you know, you could go there and no one else was going to be there with a gun.
If we are a country where the criminal doesn't know whether someone has a gun or not, they're going to think twice about opening fire or not because they won't be able to accomplish what they want. It's a wrong-headed approach that somehow or another, if we take guns away from people, law-abiding people who want to protect themselves, that the world's going to be safer. In fact, just the opposite is the case."
"Face the Nation Transcripts April 27 2014: Netanyahu, Blinken, McCaskill, Corker," www.cbsnews.com, Apr. 27, 2014

Ted Nugent Biography
Title:
Musician, hunter, and author
Position:
Con to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"It's not the weapons. The weapons have nothing to do with it. Again, these weapons are in every pickup truck in Texas. People have to get past the hardware.
I would never turn against this wonderful tool that brings me self-defense capabilities and brings me great joy in competition and marksmanship training.
In all these mass shootings, it's not a matter of bullets or firepower. A quail gun in the wrong hands is as deadly as this gun [points to an AR rifle]. People have got to come to that reality.
There is no gun violence. There is criminal violence. And they use an assortment of tools. The gun owners of America are causing no problem. Leave us alone. Let's go after the mentally deranged who are doing all these vicious crimes. Let's go after the recidivistic maggots that judges and prosecutors unleash into our neighborhoods."
Deborah Feyerick, "Ted Nugent Sings Praises of Gun Ownership," www.cnn.com, Feb. 12, 2013

GUN CONTROL
Last updated on: 4/29/2015 1:01:37 PM PST
Gun Control Home Page > Source Biographies > >Republican National Committee
Republican National Committee Biography
Position:
Con to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"We uphold the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, a right which antedated the Constitution and was solemnly confirmed by the Second Amendment. We acknowledge, support, and defend the law-abiding citizen's God-given right of self-defense… Gun ownership is responsible citizenship, enabling Americans to defend their homes and communities. We condemn frivolous lawsuits against gun manufacturer and oppose federal licensing or registration of law-abiding gun owners. We oppose legislation that is intended to restrict our Second Amendment rights by limiting the capacity of clips or magazines or otherwise restoring the ill-considered Clinton gun ban."
"2012 We Believe in America Republican Platform," www.gop.com, 2012
Theoretical Expertise Ranking:
Organizations/VIPs/OthersIndividuals and organizations that do not fit into the other star categories.
Description:
"Drawing inspiration from our Party's history, today's Republicans believe individuals, not government, make the best decisions; all people are entitled to equal rights; and decisions are best made close to home.At the state level, the nation's thirty Republican governors are making government more effective and efficient, spurring economic growth and striving to put more power in the hands of the people.Nationally, Republicans recognize that the slow, bloated, top-down Washington bureaucracy is out-of-date in the 21st century. Our Party works to give Americans more choices—in healthcare, in education, in energy, and in the economy—and to free individuals and families from the intrusive overreach of federal bureaucrats.The Party's core principles of freedom and equal opportunity are as relevant today as at our founding, and they are the roadmap for American renewal in a new and interconnected world."
"History of the GOP: Party of the Future," gop.com/history (accessed Apr. 29, 2015)
Mission:
"The Party of Opportunity. The Republican Party is fighting for a freer and stronger America where everyone has the opportunity to achieve the American Dream."

Libertarian Party Biography
Position:
Con to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"We affirm the individual right recognized by the Second Amendment to keep and bear arms, and oppose the prosecution of individuals for exercising their rights of self-defense. Private property owners should be free to establish their own conditions regarding the presence of personal defense weapons on their own property. We oppose all laws at any level of government restricting, registering, or monitoring the ownership, manufacture, or transfer of firearms or ammunition."
"Libertarian Party 2014 Platform," www.lp.org, June 2014
Theoretical Expertise Ranking:
Organizations/VIPs/OthersIndividuals and organizations that do not fit into the other star categories.
Description:
"The Libertarian Party is America's third largest and fastest growing political party. Libertarians engage in a variety of projects, working for everyone's liberty on every issue.The Libertarian Party was created in December of 1971 by people who realized that the politicians had strayed from America's original libertarian foundation, with disastrous results. Their vision was the same as that of America's founders -- a world where individuals are free to follow their own dreams in their own ways, a world of peace, harmony, opportunity, and abundance.Libertarians are practical; we know we can't make the world perfect. But, it can be better. Libertarians will keep working to create a better, freer society for everyone. As William Allen White said: 'Liberty is the only thing you cannot have unless you are willing to give it to others.'"
"Introduction: America's Third Largest Party," www.lp.org (accessed Apr. 30, 2015)
Mission:
"As Libertarians, we seek a world of liberty; a world in which all individuals are sovereign over their own lives and no one is forced to sacrifice his or her values for the benefit of others.We believe that respect for individual rights is the essential precondition for a free and prosperous world, that force and fraud must be banished from human relationships, and that only through freedom can peace and prosperity be realized.Consequently, we defend each person's right to engage in any activity that is peaceful and honest, and welcome the diversity that freedom brings. The world we seek to build is one where individuals are free to follow their own dreams in their own ways, without interference from government or any authoritarian power...Our goal is nothing more nor less than a world set free in our lifetime, and it is to this end that we take these stands."

GUN CONTROL
Last updated on: 4/30/2015 11:11:10 AM PST
Gun Control Home Page > Source Biographies > >Constitution Party
Constitution Party Biography
Position:
Con to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"The right to bear arms is inherent in the right of self defense, defense of the family, and defense against tyranny, conferred on the individual and the community by our Creator to safeguard life, liberty, and property, as well as to help preserve the independence of the nation.
The right to keep and bear arms is guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the Constitution; it may not properly be infringed upon or denied.
The Constitution Party upholds the right of the citizen to keep and bear arms. We oppose attempts to prohibit ownership of guns by law-abiding citizens, and stand against all laws which would require the registration of guns or ammunition.
We emphasize that when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have them. In such circumstances, the peaceful citizen's protection against the criminal would be seriously jeopardized.
We call for the repeal of all federal firearms legislation, beginning with Federal Firearms Act of 1968.
We call for the rescinding of all executive orders, the prohibition of any future executive orders, and the prohibition of treaty ratification which would in any way limit the right to keep and bear arms."
"Abridged 2012-2016 National Platform," www.constitutionparty.com, 2012
Theoretical Expertise Ranking:
Organizations/VIPs/OthersIndividuals and organizations that do not fit into the other star categories.
Description:
"In 1992, a number of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party. In 1999, at its national nominating convention for the 2000 elections, convention delegates chose to change the party name to the 'Constitution Party,' to better reflect the party’s core belief in the principles of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, as well as their commitment to re-establishing the Supreme Law of the Land as embodied in the Constitution."
"FAQ's [sic]," www.constitutionparty.com (accessed Apr. 30, 2015)
Mission:
"The mission of the Constitution Party is to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity through the election, at all levels of government, of Constitution Party candidates who will uphold the principles of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, and the Bill of Rights. It is our goal to limit the federal government to its delegated, enumerated, Constitutional functions."

"There is no need for a civilized society to tolerate the type of gun-related violence that Americans seem to accept as normal. The solution to gun-related crime isn't further arming the public. It involves enacting comprehensive gun control laws that prohibit many forms of gun ownership, significantly curtailing or eliminating access to and the ability to purchase guns, and implementing programs in which the government confiscates or purchases illegal guns already in circulation among the public.
For those firearms that are legal, ownership should be tied not only to background checks, but to extensive and mandatory training in the safe use and storage of weapons.
In an era of extreme concern about national security, Americans need to recognize that one of the greatest threats to national security is their own heavily armed population. Unfortunately, our proven inability to handle widespread gun ownership suggests strongly that the way to do this is to deeply restrict access to and ownership of most types of guns."

Sean Davis, MBA Biography
Title:
Cofounder and CFO of The Federalist
Position:
Con to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"[W]hat we do know is that nine innocent men and women were slaughtered in a mandatory gun-free zone by an evil madman wielding a gun.
More gun laws won't prevent evil people from doing evil things. Human nature cannot be legislated away. No amount of laws can ever eliminate evil acts committed by evil men. But gun control laws like those in South Carolina certainly can eliminate the ability of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves from those who intend to do evil. And that's a tragedy."
“No, a Lack of Gun Control Didn't Cause the Charleston Shooting,” www.thefederalist.com, June 18, 2015
Theoretical Expertise Ranking:
ExpertsIndividuals with PhDs, JDs, or equivalent advanced degrees in fields relevant to guns and gun policies. Also top-level government officials (such as foreign leaders, US presidents, Founding Fathers, Supreme Court Justices, members of legislative bodies, cabinet members, military leaders, etc.) with positions relevant to guns and gun policies.

Vince Vaughn Biography
Title:
Actor
Position:
Con to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"I support people having a gun in public full stop, not just in your home. We don't have the right to bear arms because of burglars; we have the right to bear arms to resist the supreme power of a corrupt and abusive government. It's not about duck hunting; it's about the ability of the individual. It's the same reason we have freedom of speech. It's well known that the greatest defence against an intruder is the sound of a gun hammer being pulled back. All these gun shootings that have gone down in America since 1950, only one or maybe two have happened in non-gun-free zones. Take mass shootings. They've only happened in places that don't allow guns. These people are sick in the head and are going to kill innocent people. They are looking to slaughter defenceless human beings. They do not want confrontation. In all of our schools it is illegal to have guns on campus, so again and again these guys go and shoot up these… schools because they know there are no guns there. They are monsters killing six-year-olds…
Banning guns is like banning forks in an attempt to stop making people fat. Taking away guns, taking away drugs, the booze, it won't rid the world of criminality."
Jonathan Heaf, "True Detective's Vince Vaughn on Gun Control, Edward Snowden and Comedy," www.gq-magazine.co.uk, June 1, 2015

Martin O'Malley, JD Biography
Title:
Former Governor of Maryland
Position:
Pro to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"It's time we called this what it is: a national crisis...
So now, I'm doubling down, and I need your help. What we did in Maryland should be the first step of what we do as a nation. The NRA is already blaming the victims of yesterday's shooting for their own deaths, saying they too should have been armed. Let's put an end to this madness and finally stand up to them. Here are some steps we should be taking:
1. A national assault weapons ban.
2. Stricter background checks.
3. Efforts to reduce straw-buying, like fingerprint requirements."
"O’Malley: 'I’m Pissed,' Calls for Gun Control, NRA Silencing," www.washingtonexaminer.com, June 19, 2015

Hillary Rodham Clinton, JD Biography
Title:
Former US Secretary of State
Position:
Pro to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"We can have common sense gun reforms that keep weapons out of the hands of criminals and the violently unstable while respecting responsible gun owners… The stakes are too high, the costs are too dear, and I am not and will not be afraid to keep fighting for common sense reforms, and along with you, achieve those on behalf of all who have been lost because of this senseless gun violence in this country."

American Medical Association (AMA) Biography
Position:
Pro to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"With approximately 30,000 men, women and children dying each year at the barrel of a gun in elementary schools, movie theaters, workplaces, houses of worship and on live television, the United States faces a public health crisis of gun violence... Our AMA 'recognizes that uncontrolled ownership and use of firearms, especially handguns, is a serious threat to the public's health inasmuch as the weapons are one of the main causes of intentional and unintentional injuries and deaths.' AMA policy supports legislation calling for a waiting period before purchasing any form of firearm in the U.S., and supports requiring background checks for all handgun purchasers.
Moreover, AMA policy supports stricter enforcement of present federal and state gun safety legislation, and the imposition of mandated penalties for crimes committed with the use of a firearm, including the illegal possession of a firearm."

GUN CONTROL
Last updated on: 6/16/2016 8:46:02 AM PST
Gun Control Home Page > Source Biographies > >Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein
Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein Biography
Title:
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights
Position:
Pro to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"It is hard to find a rational justification that explains the ease with which people can buy firearms, including assault rifles, in spite of prior criminal backgrounds, drug use, histories of domestic violence and mental illness, or direct contact with extremists – both domestic and foreign.
How many more mass killings of school-children, of co-workers, of African-American churchgoers -- how many more individual shootings of talented musicians like Christina Grimmie, or politicians like Gabrielle Giffords, will it take before the United States adopts robust gun regulation? Why should any civilian anywhere be able to acquire an assault rifle or other high-powered weapons designed to kill lots of people?
Irresponsible pro-gun propaganda suggests that firearms make society safer, when all evidence points to the contrary. The ready availability of guns leaves little space between murderous impulses and actions that result in death. The journey between hate-filled beliefs and violent hate crimes is accelerated. Society -- in particular its most vulnerable communities and minorities who are already facing widespread prejudice -- pay a high price for the failure to stand up to the lobbyists and take the necessary measures to protect people from gun violence.
Examples from many countries clearly show that a legal framework to control the acquisition and use of firearms has led to a dramatic reduction in violent crime."
United Nations, "In Wake of Mass Shooting, UN Rights Chief Urges US to Consider Robust Gun Control," un.org, June 14, 2016

GUN CONTROL

Gary Johnson Biography
Title:
Former Governor of New Mexico
Position:
Con to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"I am in the camp that if you outlaw guns only the criminals are going to have guns. I supported permitting the concealed carry of handguns in New Mexico. I believe there is a lot less violence in the parking lot, as they say, because the potential perpetrator of a theft or an assault is thinking twice because someone might be carrying a gun. Restrictions on gun ownership will only encourage outlaws to have heavy ammunition and high calibre weapons."

Jeb Bush Biography
Title:
Former Governor of Florida
Position:
Con to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"In this particular case [the Emanuel AME church shooting in Charleston, SC], the FBI made a mistake. The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job. Because that person [Dylann Roof], should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check. The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens…
I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is. It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away. You're going away for a long, long while."

Sharon Risher, MDiv Biography
Title:
Reverend and Spokesperson for Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America
Position:
Pro to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"Two years ago my mother and cousins were gunned down by a white supremacist during a prayer service at their beloved Mother Emanuel Church. That hate-filled man never should have gotten his hands on a gun, and yet, through a loophole, he was able to arm himself and take the lives of nine beautiful church-goers, peacefully in prayer. If a full background check had been completed, my mother, cousins and six other loved ones would still be alive today…Between 2010 and 2016, the Charleston loophole allowed nearly 23,000 gun sales to dangerous people who would have failed a criminal background check because the check could not be completed within three business days. After the three-day period has expired, federal law allows gun stores to sell a gun to a prospective buyer, even though the background check is not complete…Background checks that have been completed have blocked more than two million sales to people who failed a background check, and have saved countless lives."
"Everytown, Moms Demand Action Applaud Rep. Clyburn's Legislation to Close 'Charleston Loophole' That Allowed Charleston Shooter to Obtain Gun without a Complete Background Check," momsdemandaction.org, July 28, 2017

GUN CONTROL
Last updated on: 10/5/2017 6:21:28 PM PST
Gun Control Home Page > Source Biographies > >National Rifle Association (NRA)
National Rifle Association (NRA) Biography
Position:
Con to the question "Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?"
Reasoning:
"Voters know that gun safety does not mean whittling away at their Right to Keep and Bear Arms. It doesn't mean restricting where or how a law-abiding citizen can exercise a constitutionally protected right. And, it certainly doesn't mean forcing hunters or target shooters to go to a Federally Licensed Firearm dealer for a background check before they can borrow each other's guns for an afternoon.
Real gun safety is the fact that over the last 20 years, the annual number of gun-related accidental deaths has decreased by more than half. Or the fact that guns are only involved in 0.4% of accidental deaths among the U.S. population. Real gun safety is also found in the training programs that the NRA offers each year by one of our more than 125,000 NRA Certified Instructors and Range Safety Officers.
The gun control agenda has one goal, and it has nothing to do with keeping people safe. Instead, it has everything to do with decreasing the number of guns in America and making them more difficult to legally purchase. That doesn't make Americans safer?—it simply makes them unarmed and vulnerable."
"No. Gun Control Is NOT a Winning Issue," medium.com, June 29, 2017
[Editor's Note: On Oct. 5 the NRA released a joint statement from CEO and Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre and Chief Lobbyist for the NRA-ILA Chris Cox that included a reaffirmation of the organization's stance against gun control, and the following: "The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations." The statement was made in response to the shooting in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, 2017 in which the shooter used bump stocks to make semi-automatic guns function like automatic guns.]

Description:
"Dismayed by the lack of marksmanship shown by their troops, Union veterans Col. William C. Church and Gen. George Wingate formed the National Rifle Association in 1871. The primary goal of the association would be to "promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis," according to a magazine editorial written by Church.After being granted a charter by the state of New York on November 17, 1871, the NRA was founded. In civilian training, the NRA continues to be the leader in firearms education. Over 125,000 certified instructors now train about 1,000,000 gun owners a year. While widely recognized today as a major political force and as America's foremost defender of Second Amendment rights, the NRA has, since its inception, been the premier firearms education organization in the world."
"A Brief History of the NRA," nra.org (accessed on Sep. 4, 2017)
Mission:
"Together, we fight and win the toughest battles for the Second Amendment, all while offering the best firearms educational programs in the country.Every day, the NRA fights back against politicians, judges, and bureaucrats who want to regulate, restrict, and ultimately, destroy your Second Amendment freedom."
